To achieve this goal, I need to be good at earning money — but that's only one side of the coin. Saving money is at least as important.\n\n> \"Wealth is what you haven't spent.\"  \n> — Unknown\n\nFortunately, I was able to learn about saving quite early from my parents. Since I was a child, my father told me: \"Set aside 10% of your income every month and you won't have money worries.\"\n\nIn my view, the ability to save is one of the most important skills you should have. \"Save for what?\" you might ask. The answer: Because saving is awesome. Saving builds wealth and gives you the freedom to decide what you want. In a job interview, you simply have a better position when you know you don't need the job.\n\n## Are You a Good Saver? 10 Signs That You're Not\n\n### 1. You save at the end of the month instead of the beginning\n\nWhen I can manage it, I always get up a bit earlier in the morning to work on my projects. This is the only way I can be sure I have enough time for blog articles and reading.\n\nJust as I invest in myself at the start of the day, you should do the same with saving: Set aside your savings rate at the beginning of the month, not at the end.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"info\" \n  title=\"Quick Fix\" \n  content=\"Set up an automatic transfer to put money aside at the beginning of the month.\" \n/>\n\n### 2. You don't keep track of expenses\n\nMost people don't have a clear overview of their expenses. Can you say off the top of your head:\n\n- How much money you need fixed each month?\n- How much things cost?\n- What's monthly and what's one-time?\n\nWhen I read something like this, it sends chills down my spine. 22% of Germans don't even know if they're saving. It's impossible to be financially independent this way.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"warning\" \n  title=\"Take Action\" \n  content=\"Open your account overview and go through the last 6 months: What regular costs do you find? Record them in a structured way. At the end, you should have a list of all regular costs.\" \n/>\n\n### 3. You confuse assets and liabilities\n\nIf you had to guess: Is a car an asset or a liability? Now you'll answer: \"It depends on whether the car is paid off!\" — absolutely correct.\n\nFrom a cash flow perspective (Recommendation: the book \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\"), a car is a liability: Through fuel, insurance, and repairs, money flows out of your pond. A stock, on the other hand, is an asset: It generates positive cash flow through appreciation or dividends.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"info\" \n  title=\"Perspective Shift\" \n  content=\"Look around: What do others consider an asset that from a cash flow perspective is actually more of a liability?\" \n/>\n\n### 4. You can't survive 6 months without a job\n\nAfter becoming self-employed in 2017, my declared goal was: Being able to survive 6 months without money. My second goal: Being able to eat out every day ;) I achieved both within the first year.\n\nSince 2020, I'm employed again — another nice story — and even now a large buffer proves very reassuring. It gives me negotiating security and lets me appear more confident.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"success\" \n  title=\"Emergency Fund\" \n  content=\"How much money do you need to not work for 6 months? Calculate the amount and start setting it aside step by step — the beginning of your emergency fund.\" \n/>\n\n### 5. You have no saving strategy\n\nYou might already be saving and have 1,000, 10,000, or even 100,000 USD in your account. However, you lack a strategy for what to do with it. A saving strategy clarifies not only how much you save, but where to and how much you're allowed to spend.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"info\" \n  title=\"Strategic Planning\" \n  content=\"Be clear about how much money you have for saving. Subtract your emergency reserves (6 months). What's left over now, you invest.\" \n/>\n\n### 6. You keep buying more expensive things\n\n\"It doesn't matter how much I earn. When more comes into the account, I spend more\" — someone told me at a party. Of course, you want to live differently at 40 than you did at 20 in student housing. There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"warning\" \n  title=\"Prioritize\" \n  content=\"Be clear about what you absolutely want to have now and what you can do without for now.\" \n/>\n\n### 7. You compare yourself with others\n\nThe financial situation of most people out there is not comparable to yours. For this reason, it's not helpful to compare your strategy with others'.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"info\" \n  title=\"Personal Assessment\" \n  content=\"Go through factors like liabilities, income, and risk tolerance. Does your current strategy fit your situation?\" \n/>\n\n### 8. You rely on pension\n\nWill you someday have a pension you can live on? I can't answer that question for you — but if you provide for it now, you certainly won't think in old age \"What a mess, now I've saved money here for old age!\"\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"warning\" \n  title=\"Future Planning\" \n  content=\"Do you know the amount you'll receive net in retirement? A good time to find that out. Have you also considered inflation until then?\" \n/>\n\n### 9. You're surprised by bills\n\nFor some people, bills seem to be like Christmas: They come unexpectedly every year. Even as a private individual, it makes sense to have a small form of \"bill management.\"\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"info\" \n  title=\"Bill Management\" \n  content=\"Go back to your monthly expenses and split large bills into small 'monthly bites' and add them up.\" \n/>\n\n### 10. You don't consciously set aside money for wishes\n\nWhen you save money, it makes sense to distinguish between long-term and short-term saving. Spending money is easy, but the line between cost-benefit and actual value shouldn't be lost sight of.\n\n<InfoBox \n  type=\"success\" \n  title=\"Goal Setting\" \n  content=\"What do you want to save for in the near future? Divide the amount into small bites and create an automatic transfer for it.\" \n/>\n\n## Your Path to Financial Improvement\n\nRecognizing these signs is the first step toward improving your financial habits.

Not shocking, right? But here's where it gets interesting - even as income increases, financial struggles persist.\n\n<InfoBox\n  title=\"Key Statistics: Income vs. Financial Struggle\"\n  content={`\n<table class=\"w-full\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th class=\"text-left\">Income Level</th>\n      <th class=\"text-left\">Living Paycheck to Paycheck</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>$50,000</td>\n      <td>35%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>$50k-$80k</td>\n      <td>35%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>$80k-$99k</td>\n      <td>36%</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>$150k+</td>\n      <td>20%</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n`}\n/>\n\n**The key takeaway:** Your income isn't the problem - your habits are.\n\n## The Financial Literacy Crisis\n\n<InfoBox content=\"Financial literacy isn't just about knowledge - it's about behavior. Poor money habits can affect anyone, regardless of income level.\" />\n\nThis isn't just statistics; it's costing you real money.\n\nLet me share my story: In 2016, I had just a few hundred bucks in my account. Every day was stressful. I never wanted to feel that way again. Here's what I learned about the habits that keep people poor - regardless of their income.\n\n## 5 Destructive Money Habits\n\n### 1. Emotional Spending\n\nWe've all been there - buying something to feel better. It's that quick dopamine hit, like a sugar rush for your brain. But just like sugar, it's short-lived and leaves you wanting more.\n\n### 2. Avoiding Money\n\nThis is the ostrich approach - head in the sand, hoping money problems will solve themselves. I had a colleague earning €4,000 monthly (great money in Germany) who saved exactly zero. Why? He never looked at his finances.\n\n### 3. The \"I'll Save When I Earn More\" Myth\n\n<InfoBox content=\"Make this rule today - 10% of every future raise goes straight to savings. No exceptions.\" />\n\nThis is the biggest lie we tell ourselves. I've seen it countless times: people get a raise and their spending magically rises to match it. When I was employed, I made a rule: **10% of every raise went straight to savings**.\n\n### 4. Chasing Quick Money\n\nBitcoin millionaires, meme stocks, the next big thing - it's tempting. But here's a reality check: 96% of professional fund managers don't beat the market over 20 years. What makes you think you can?\n\n### 5. Linking Money to Self-Worth\n\nThis is perhaps the most dangerous habit. When your self-worth is tied to your net worth, you'll never feel like you have enough. It's like trying to fill an emotional hole with money - it never works.\n\n## The Path Forward\n\n<InfoBox\n  title=\"Your Action Plan\"\n  content={`\n1. Face your numbers (no matter how scary)\n2. Set up automatic savings\n3. Create a sustainable investment strategy\n4. Stop emotional spending\n5. Define your real life goals\n`}\n/>\n\nRemember: It's not about how much you make, it's about the habits you build. I've seen people with modest incomes build wealth while high earners live paycheck to paycheck. The difference? These five habits.\n\n> **Start Today:** Pick just one of these habits to work on this week. Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest difference.\n\n---","src/data/post/5-money-habits-that-keep-you-poor-even-with-a-high-income.mdx","b2082068933883ce","etf-investment-returns-conservative-vs-aggressive-whats-your-strategy",{id:41,data:43,body:51,filePath:52,digest:53,deferredRender:26},{publishDate:44,title:45,excerpt:46,image:47,tags:48},["Date","2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"],"ETF Investment Returns: Conservative vs. Aggressive - What's Your Strategy?","Discover how €10,000 grows differently with conservative, moderate, and aggressive ETF strategies over 10 years, and find which approach matches your goals.","~/assets/images/feature_images/image_14.png",[49,50],"investing","etf","Let's talk about €10,000 and what happens to it over 10 years with different ETF strategies. I've created an ETF Growth Calculator to show you exactly how your investment style affects your returns.\n\n## The Three Paths to Growth\n\nUsing my calculator, let's look at a €10,000 initial investment over 10 years. We see three distinct paths:\n\n1. Conservative (6%): Grows to €17,908\n2. Moderate (8%): Reaches €21,589\n3. Aggressive (10%): Expands to €25,937\n\nThe difference? A whopping €8,029 between conservative and aggressive approaches. Try it yourself with my free ETF calculator.\n\n## What These Numbers Really Mean\n\nThe conservative strategy (6%) might be your government bonds and defensive ETFs. Think steady growth, lower stress. You'll sleep well, but your money works less hard.\n\nThe moderate path (8%) is your classic world index ETF strategy. It's how I started - broad market exposure without excessive risk. The extra 2% over conservative adds €3,681 to your final amount.\n\nGoing aggressive (10%) means adding growth stocks or emerging markets ETFs to your mix. Yes, it could mean more volatility, but also €4,348 more than the moderate strategy.\n\n## Making Your Choice\n\nYour strategy choice isn't just about the highest number. Consider:\n\n1. When do you need the money?\n2. Can you stomach seeing your investment drop 20% temporarily?\n3. Are you investing more money monthly? Test different scenarios in my calculator\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n- **Conservative**: €17,908 - Safe but slower growth\n- **Moderate**: €21,589 - Balanced approach\n- **Aggressive**: €25,937 - Higher potential, higher risk\n\nThe best strategy? It's the one that lets you sleep at night while moving toward your goals. Try different scenarios in the calculator and find your comfort zone.\n\n> Want to learn more about choosing your investment strategy?

That's not investment losses—that's pure waste from a lack of financial knowledge.\n\n### The Hard Truth About Financial Literacy\n\nHere's what's really going on: Financial literacy in the U.S. has been stuck at around 50% for eight years straight. Think about that—half of Americans don't understand basic money concepts. Even more alarming, according to the 2024 P-Fin Index, this number has dropped by 2% in the last two years. That means it's actually getting worse.\n\n## Why Financial Literacy Matters\n\n### Avoiding Financial Pitfalls\n\nFinancial literacy helps individuals steer clear of costly mistakes like accumulating too much debt, mismanaging credit cards, or falling prey to predatory lending practices. When you understand basic principles, you can avoid financial traps that many people fall into. In fact, [10 signs you're bad with money](/10-signs-youre-bad-with-money-and-how-to-change-that) often stem from a lack of financial literacy.\n\n### Economic Stability\n\nA financially literate population doesn't just benefit individuals—it drives overall economic growth. Informed decisions about spending, saving, and investing contribute to a more stable and resilient economy.\n\n### Empowerment\n\nUnderstanding money isn't just practical—it's powerful. It equips you to make informed choices, navigate complex financial systems, and secure your financial well-being. Confidence with money is the foundation of freedom.\n\n## Why People Don't Plan Their Finances\n\nHere's a statistic that might blow your mind: According to Schwab's Modern Wealth Survey, 44% of Americans believe they don't have enough money to need a financial plan. That's backward thinking! Saying you're too broke to plan is like saying you're too hungry to eat.\n\n> Planning isn't for the rich; it's how you get rich. And it starts with understanding the basics.\n\n## The Wealth Triangle\n\nTo help simplify the process of financial management, I've created a framework called The Wealth Triangle. It's designed to work for anyone, no matter how much or how little money you have.\n\nHere's how it breaks down:\n\n1. **Income**\n\n   - Understanding and maximizing your cash inflow\n   - Knowing where your income comes from\n   - Learning how to grow it strategically\n\n2. **Spending**\n\n   - Learning when to spend and when to save\n   - Prioritizing expenses to align with goals\n   - Tracking expenses and living below your means\n\n3. **Investing**\n   - Making your money work for you\n   - Understanding investment options (stocks, real estate, etc.)\n   - Building long-term wealth through smart allocation\n\n## The Impact of Financial Stress\n\n### Mental and Physical Health\n\nAccording to Ally Financial, 45% of Americans are stressed about their finances. This stress isn't limited to those with low incomes—it affects people across all age groups and income levels.\n\n#### Mental Health Impact\n\n- Financial stress is deeply tied to psychological distress\n- Lower incomes or unemployment lead to higher anxiety and depression\n- Money concerns affect overall mental well-being\n\n#### Physical Health Impact\n\n- Chronic financial stress can cause:\n  - Migraines\n  - Heart issues\n  - Digestive problems\n- Long-term impact on overall health\n\n## Building Your Financial Foundation\n\nUnderstanding financial concepts is just the beginning. To truly master your finances, you need practical frameworks that help you organize your money effectively.\n\nOne approach I've found particularly useful is [the Wealth Triangle framework](/wealth-triangle), which provides a simple yet powerful way to structure your finances for both security and growth.\n\n## Taking Action: From Knowledge to Practice\n\nFinancial literacy isn't just about knowing—it's about doing. Here are some practical steps to improve your financial situation:\n\n1. Start by [learning how to save money effectively](/how-to-save-money), which is the foundation of all wealth building\n2. Once you have savings, consider [how to start investing](/how-to-start-investing-in-2025) to grow your wealth\n3. Use tools like [the Wealth Canvas](/the-wealth-canvas-a-new-way-to-see-your-money-journey) to visualize your entire financial picture\n\n## Your Action Plan for Financial Literacy\n\n### 1. Get Crystal Clear About Your Money\n\nStart by visualizing your entire financial situation. Use tools like The Wealth Canvas to lay out your income, expenses, debts, and savings on one page. This clarity is the first step toward gaining confidence with your finances.\n\n### 2. Master Your Spending\n\nFollow my 4 Rules for Stress-Free Spending Decisions:\n\n- Differentiate between needs and wants\n- Set clear spending limits\n- Review expenditures regularly\n- Align spending with your long-term goals\n\n### 3. Build Your Financial Education\n\n- **Online Courses**: Begin with free resources on platforms like Coursera or edX\n- **Books**: Read one financial book monthly (start with \"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\")\n- **Expert Guidance**: Follow credible financial experts on social media\n- **Community Learning**: Join finance forums and local meetups\n\n### 4. Create Systems That Work\n\n- **Automate savings**: Set up automatic transfers post-paycheck\n- **Use budgeting apps**: Implement tools like YNAB or Wallet\n- **Regular reviews**: Calculate net worth monthly, review spending weekly\n\n### 5. Handle Life Changes Smartly\n\nMajor financial events like receiving an inheritance require careful planning. Follow guides like my \"First 30 Days After Inheriting Money\" for practical steps.\n\n## Take Action Today\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"Get Started Now\"\n  content=\"Financial literacy isn't about becoming a Wall Street wizard.

Let me take you back to a summer evening that changed how I think about money forever.\n\nPicture this: I'm six years old, sitting in a busy restaurant, my mouth watering at the thought of ice cream. The sweet, cold dessert that every kid dreams about on a hot summer day. When I asked my dad for some money to buy it, he didn't just say no - he gave me a challenge that would shape my entire future.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content='If you want ice cream,\" he said with a knowing smile, you willl have to figure out how to earn the money yourself.'\n/>\n\nMost kids might have given up right there. But something clicked in my brain. I looked around the restaurant, grabbed some paper from my mom's purse, and started drawing. Not masterpieces - just simple, kid-style doodles. Then, with my heart pounding but determined to get that ice cream, I did something that probably makes most people cringe: I went from table to table, selling my drawings for 50 cents each.\n\nGuess what? It worked. I got my ice cream that day, but I got something way more valuable too: my first lesson about the connection between money and emotions.\n\nFast forward to today - I'm managing my own money (that's a lot more ice cream than I could ever eat!). But here's the crazy part: that little kid selling drawings in a restaurant had no idea that twenty-some years later, he'd lose €40,000 in a single investment and be totally okay with it. How is that possible?\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"If you've ever felt nervous about money, doubted your financial decisions, or wondered why you buy things you don't really need when you're stressed (we've all been there!), you're going to want to hear this...\"\n/>\n\n## How I Learned About Money and Feelings\n\nGrowing up in a middle-class family, we weren't rich, but we weren't poor either. My dad taught me a lot about money - like always saving at least 10% of what I earn (I actually try to save way more now!). He was kind of like my money coach, teaching me to think carefully before buying stuff.\n\n## The Big Discovery: Money and Feelings Are Best Friends\n\nHere's something crazy I discovered in 2021 when I was going to therapy: I noticed that when I was feeling stressed during therapy sessions, I would start trading stocks like crazy! It's like when some people eat lots of ice cream when they're sad - except I was buying and selling stocks.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"In 2021, I spent 20,000 EUR on trading commissions. Luckily, I still managed to get out of 2021 with 8,000 EUR in profit. If I had changed nothing and kept my first trade in 2021, I would have closed the year with roughly 100,000 EUR.\"\n/>\n\nThis made me realize something super important: our feelings about money come from way back in our childhood. Just like my ice cream story shaped how I think about earning money, your experiences with money are shaping how you think about it too!\n\n## The Three-Way Check: Your Inner Financial Advisors\n\nWhen I'm thinking about buying something, I use what I call my \"three-way check.\" I learned this from a smart guy named Tim Ferriss. It's like having three different advisors in your head:\n\n### 1. Your Brain (The Thinking Part)\n\n- Asks: \"Does this make sense?\"\n- Example: When I bought my new MacBook Air, my brain said, \"This will help me work faster!\"\n\n### 2. Your Heart (The Feeling Part)\n\n- Asks: \"How do I feel about this?\"\n- Example: My heart said, \"This feels like a good investment in my work.\"\n\n### 3. Your Gut (The Instinct Part)\n\n- Asks: \"What's my gut telling me?\"\n- Example: My gut said, \"This is the right time to buy it.\"\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"Your brain is good at rationalizing things. Usually, your gut will tell you if you really want something because it makes sense or if it's just cheap dopamine you want.\"\n/>\n\n## How This Connects to My Wealth Triangle\n\nYou might have read about my Wealth Triangle (if you haven't, [check it out here](/wealth-triangle)). It's like a pyramid with three parts:\n\n- The Foundation (safety money)\n- The Growth Zone (steady investment money)\n- The Opportunity Zone (exciting but risky money)\n\nBut here's the cool thing - your feelings affect how you use each part of the triangle! For example, when I was stressed, I wanted to put more money in the Opportunity Zone, which isn't always smart.\n\n## Real Life Example: Learning the Hard Way\n\nWant to hear something that taught me a big lesson? I once invested €40,000 (that's like 40,000 ice creams!) in a friend's company. The company went bankrupt, and I lost all that money. Losing that much money isn't fun and even made me doubt myself sometimes.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"And I think that's completely fine. Taking risks can lead to losses, and losing is no fun. At the same time, it shouldn't keep you from playing.\"\n/>\n\nI didn't feel terrible about it because it was part of my Opportunity Zone money - money I knew I could lose without ruining my life. This is why the Wealth Triangle is so important.\n\n## Smart Money Moves I Make Now\n\n### 1. Books Are Always Worth It\n\n- I buy books whenever I find ones I like\n- This comes from my parents always buying me books as a kid\n- It's like investing in my brain!\n\n### 2. Quality Food Matters\n\n- I don't eat at fancy restaurants all the time\n- But I buy good quality food for cooking\n- Think of it like putting good fuel in a car\n\n### 3. Tools That Help Me Work\n\n- Like my MacBook Air story\n- Sometimes spending more now saves money later\n\n## Warning Signs to Watch For\n\nWhen you're making decisions about money, watch out for these feelings:\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"- Feeling rushed ('Buy it now or you'll miss out!')<br/>\n- Feeling pressured ('Everyone else is doing it!')<br/>\n- Feeling scared of missing out (FOMO)\"\n/>\n\nIf you feel any of these, stop and take a deep breath. Remember: there will always be more chances to make money or buy things you want.\n\n## What I Want You to Remember\n\nThe way you think about money is super important. It's not just about having a piggy bank or a savings account - it's about understanding why you make the choices you do with money.\n\nRemember my ice cream story? That little kid learning to earn money for ice cream grew up to manage his own wealth. But the most important thing I learned wasn't about making money - it was about understanding my feelings about money.\n\n### Want to start thinking better about money? Try this:\n\n1. Notice how you feel when you want to buy something\n2. Use the three-way check (brain, heart, gut)\n3. Remember that there's usually no rush\n4. Think about which part of the Wealth Triangle your decision fits into\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"Have a closer look: [10 reasons you are not good with money](/10-reasons-you-are-not-good-with-money)\"\n/>\n\n## Your Turn!\n\nWhat's your earliest memory about money? How did it make you feel? Understanding this might help you make better choices about money today.\n\n---\n\nP.S.

She told me, half-jokingly, that she needed to sit in a corner and hyperventilate after just glancing at a few investment articles. If you’ve ever felt your heart race at the mere mention of ETFs, market volatility, or anything involving percentages, you’re not alone. The good news is that investing doesn’t have to be complicated—especially if you understand a few foundational ideas and learn how to keep it simple.\n\nMy €50,000 Lesson: Why Simplicity Matters\n\nYes, you read that correctly: I lost €50,000 by trusting bad investment advice and paying excessive fees. First, the advisor’s chosen portfolio performed worse than a basic All-World ETF. Second, I was paying up to 4% per year in various charges, which became a massive drag on my returns.\n\nAlthough I sometimes call this my “investment education fund,” it taught me one invaluable lesson: the simplest approach is often the best one. In many cases, you really don’t need complex strategies or endless research to get started.\n\nIt’s Normal to Feel Anxious\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed or break into a cold sweat whenever someone mentions “the market,” rest assured you’re not alone. Most of us never learned how to invest in school, so it’s completely natural to be wary of unfamiliar terms like ETF or TER. The key is to acknowledge that some initial anxiety is normal, but you can move beyond it with straightforward information and small, manageable steps.\n\nWhat Is an ETF?\n\nAn ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is essentially a collection—or basket—of stocks. Instead of trying to pick individual winners, you buy small stakes in a broad range of companies all at once. Think of it like ordering a sampler platter at a restaurant: it’s a lot less risky than betting everything on a single entrée. For anxious investors, ETFs can be a great solution because they provide natural diversification, tend to have lower fees compared to actively managed funds, and remove the need to track every stock individually.\n\nThe One-and-Done Strategy\n\nIf you cringe at the thought of crunching numbers or constantly following market news, you might prefer a single ETF that covers a broad slice of the global market. For European investors, a popular choice is the Vanguard All-World UCITS ETF or an MSCI World ETF. For those in the U.S., Vanguard’s VT (Total World Stock ETF) is a similar option.\n\nBy choosing one globally diversified ETF, you eliminate the need to juggle multiple funds or rebalance your portfolio often. It’s a simple, effective approach for people who just want to invest regularly without overcomplicating the process.\n\nThree Simple Checkpoints (Even If You Hate Math)\n\nWhen picking an ETF, it’s wise to confirm a few key details, even if you’re not a numbers person. First, make sure the fund manages at least €100–200 million in assets; a higher asset base often suggests better liquidity and lower volatility. Second, check the ETF’s age. Ideally, look for funds that have been around for 5–10 years so you can see a longer performance history. Finally, review its Total Expense Ratio (TER) to ensure it’s below around 0.3% per year, as high fees eat directly into your returns.\n\nAutomate Your Investments: The Secret to Stress-Free Compounding\n\nOne major reason people avoid investing is the fear of getting it wrong. Automation can help by turning regular contributions into a simple, hands-off process. Open a low-cost brokerage account, pick your global ETF, and set up a monthly savings plan. After that, you can essentially forget about it while still benefiting from dollar-cost averaging—where you buy shares at different prices over time, which can smooth out market fluctuations.\n\nThis automated approach reduces emotional decisions, like panic-selling on a bad day or constantly watching prices. It’s an excellent way to stay consistent and let the market’s long-term growth work in your favor.\n\nWho Does This Strategy Suit?\n\nIf you have at least 10 years before you need the money, you can treat your portfolio as a slow-but-steady growth engine. This single-ETF approach also works well for anyone who prefers simplicity over chasing every last percentage point. The less you fuss with your investments, the more time you’ll have for other areas of life—and often, the fewer mistakes you’ll make.\n\nHowever, if you’re approaching retirement within the next five to ten years or you need the money sooner, you might want a more conservative plan. In that case, you could add bond ETFs, treasuries, or other stable assets. You can also consult a financial advisor for guidance that’s tailored to your circumstances.\n\nA Note on Brokers and Platforms\n\nChoosing the right broker is nearly as important as selecting the right ETF. Look for a platform that offers low or zero trading fees, an intuitive interface, and the option to set up automated savings plans. In Germany, popular choices include Scalable Capital, Trade Republic, and Comdirect. In the U.S., many people go with Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab due to their well-established reputations and competitive fees.\n\nRisk Management 101\n\nEveryone’s risk tolerance is different, so start at a pace that won’t keep you awake at night. If you’re especially nervous, you could begin with smaller monthly contributions. Over time, you may feel more comfortable increasing these amounts as you watch your balance grow. Remember, investing is a long-term endeavor. Daily market swings might look dramatic, but they matter less if you’re invested for a decade or more.\n\nIf a single equity ETF still feels too risky, consider adding a small allocation to bond ETFs or other low-volatility assets. Spreading out your money can reduce extreme ups and downs, especially if your timeline is shorter.\n\nCommon Pitfalls\n\nEven with a simple approach, there are some traps to avoid. Panic-selling when the market dips is perhaps the biggest mistake; you lock in losses and miss the rebound. Over-diversifying—buying multiple ETFs that essentially invest in the same companies—can also complicate things unnecessarily. And finally, ignoring basic due diligence can lead you to pick a poorly managed fund, so always check an ETF’s size, age, and fee structure.\n\nConclusion: Embrace Simple, Steady Growth\n\nIf the thought of diving into the stock market makes your heart race, rest assured that you can keep things simple yet effective. A single, globally diversified ETF, coupled with automated monthly contributions, removes much of the stress and guesswork.

If so, you’re not alone—welcome to the world of **imposter syndrome**. It’s that nagging voice telling you your successes are luck and your failures are proof of your worthlessness. I’ve lived with it for 20 years, and I’ve seen it hold back everyone from multimillion-dollar CEOs to everyday employees.\n\nFor people like us, imposter syndrome isn’t just annoying—it’s a roadblock. It stops us from chasing dreams, like starting a YouTube channel or asking for a raise. But what if I told you AI could help you silence that voice? Today, I’ll share **three simple AI-powered frameworks** that helped me start my own channel—plus a **bonus tool** that’s a total game-changer.\n\n> **Struggling with self-doubt?** Watch this video for more insights: [Overcoming Imposter Syndrome with AI](https://youtu.be/MzaXuV-Ip9g).\n\n## Why Imposter Syndrome Holds Us Back\n\nLet me share a story. At university, good grades felt like flukes. When my work was praised, I brushed it off as politeness. But when my software-as-a-service company tanked due to high unit economics, that inner voice screamed, _“See? This is the real you—worthless.”_ That’s imposter syndrome in action, and it kept me stuck for years.\n\nIt wasn’t until I discovered AI tools that I found a way to break free. These strategies turned my self-doubt into fuel for growth—and they can do the same for you.\n\n## Benefits of Using AI to Overcome Imposter Syndrome\n\n### 1. Reframe Your Mindset\n\nAI can flip negative thoughts into empowering ones, giving you a fresh perspective on your worth.\n\n### 2. Build Confidence Through Practice\n\nSimulating tough conversations (like pitching a raise) with AI prepares you for real-life wins.\n\n### 3. Uncover Your Strengths\n\nAI can ask the right questions to reveal what you _do_ know, silencing the “I’m not enough” narrative.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"Peace of Mind\"\n  content=\"Using AI isn’t about perfection—it’s about progress. It’s a tool to quiet the noise and focus on what matters: your potential.\"\n/>\n\n## Three AI Frameworks to Conquer Imposter Syndrome\n\n### #1 Reframe Negative Thoughts with AI\n\nWhat if AI could turn “I’m a fraud” into “I’m a work in progress”? Here’s how:\n\n- Open your favorite language model (I use Grok!).\n- Use this prompt: _“You’re an expert in busting negative thoughts. Help me overcome them by reframing them. Ask 1-3 questions for context if needed.”_\n- Add your context. Mine was: _“I feel like an imposter because I want to start a YouTube channel about decoding systems and personal development with AI. I think it’s a stupid idea—who’d listen?”_\n\nGrok might ask:\n\n1. What inspired you to start this channel?\n2. Who might benefit from your content?\n3. What experience makes you qualified?\n\nMy answers—loving systems, helping lifelong learners, 20 years of self-discovery—turned into reframes like: _“This isn’t stupid; it’s unique and timely. My journey with AI gives me something valuable to share.”_ Instant mindset shift!\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"💡 Bonus Boost: Your imposter syndrome isn’t a flaw—it’s proof you care enough to get it right.\"\n/>\n\n### #2 Simulate Conversations with AI\n\nNervous about pitching an idea to your boss? Let AI play the role. Try this:\n\n- Prompt: _“Act like my supervisor—a numbers-driven skeptic. Simulate a conversation where I pitch [your idea]. Point out weak spots and help me improve.”_\n- Context: _“I want a raise because I boosted customer retention by 15%, adding $1M in revenue.”_\n\nAI might respond: _“15% sounds good, but how much of that $1M is directly from you? What were the costs?”_ This forces you to refine your pitch—suddenly, you’re ready for the real thing.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  title=\"Prep Tip\"\n  content=\"Don’t just wing it—use AI to anticipate tough questions. It’s like a dress rehearsal for confidence.\"\n/>\n\n### #3 Let AI Ask You Questions\n\nFeel like you don’t know enough? Flip the script—let AI quiz you. Prompt:\n\n- _“I want to start a YouTube channel about AI and personal development. Ask me questions to help me overcome imposter syndrome, then evaluate my answers.”_\n\nSample questions:\n\n1. What skills do you bring to AI?\n2. Why are you passionate about this?\n3. What challenge have you overcome?\n\nMy answers—I’m a systems nerd, AI transformed my life, I’ve battled imposter syndrome for 20 years—proved I _do_ know enough. AI’s evaluation? _“Your passion and experience shine—keep building on that!”_\n\n<Timeline\n  items={[\n    {\n      title: 'Step 1',\n      description: 'Pick a topic you’re doubting yourself on.',\n      icon: 'tabler:pencil',\n    },\n    {\n      title: 'Step 2',\n      description: 'Ask AI to quiz you about it—write or speak your answers.',\n      icon: 'tabler:question-mark',\n    },\n    {\n      title: 'Step 3',\n      description: 'Review AI’s feedback to see your strengths emerge.',\n      icon: 'tabler:check',\n    },\n  ]}\n  classes={{\n    title: 'mt-0',\n    panel: 'items-start',\n    icon: 'mt-5',\n  }}\n/>\n\n## Bonus Tool: Super Whisper\n\nHere’s the fourth trick: **Super Whisper**, a voice-to-text tool that makes AI interactions effortless. Press a key, speak your thoughts, and it transcribes instantly. No more typing struggles—just paste it into Grok or ChatGPT for richer context.

For 20 years, I've been bouncing between molecular biology, SaaS founding, digital marketing, and AI. And through all of it, I never felt like I was coming home. I always felt scattered, sad, and uncertain about the overarching theme of my life.\n\n<YouTube id=\"HEoD0YKAxIE\" />\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"Too many of us are feeling stuck and unsure what to do with our lives. Today, I'll share a simple 20-minute process that helped me discover my purpose using AI.\"\n/>\n\n## Why Finding Your Purpose Matters\n\nYou might think \"purpose\" is just another buzzword. Find your purpose and suddenly everything becomes easier, right? In some sense, that's true. But purpose alone doesn't change anything—you have to live it.\n\nThe most important thing about finding your purpose is that it gives you a North Star, an inner compass to help you make decisions:\n\n- Should you work abroad?\n- Should you marry that person?\n- Should you have children?\n- Which job should you take?\n\nAll these questions become easier to answer when you have an inner compass guiding you toward what's right for you.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"We live in a world where everything is possible at every second of your life. It's more important than ever to have internal guidance that helps you navigate difficult decisions.\"\n/>\n\n## My Disconnected Journey\n\nAll the things I did in my career felt awkwardly disconnected from each other:\n\n- Molecular biology\n- Software as a service founder\n- Digital marketing\n- AI\n\nHow did these fit together? I had seriously no clue.\n\nFor 25 years, I felt trapped by the idea that I needed to find \"one niche.\" I struggled with imposter syndrome after my SaaS company tanked. Even after successfully scaling events to 5,000 attendees, I still thought it was just luck. And I delayed starting my YouTube channel for years because I felt like a fraud.\n\nWhat I didn't realize was that my polymath nature—coding since age 13, exploring personal development, playing piano, working with AI at Histack, and diving into philosophy—wasn't a weakness. It was actually the key to my purpose.\n\n## The AI Breakthrough Moment\n\nLuckily, I started using AI as an interactive journaling tool where I could input my thoughts and receive crystal clear feedback on things I had never considered before.\n\nAfter entering my data, I got a perspective on my life I'd never had before: **I'm someone who decodes systems**.\n\nThe second I read this from the AI, it felt natural. I suddenly realized that this was my overarching theme all along. Whether I was studying molecular biology or building software, I was always decoding systems.\n\nI had told ChatGPT, \"I want to start a YouTube channel about personal wealth, but I feel like an imposter—help me overcome it.\" This simple prompt unlocked insights that led me to my purpose as a system decoder for polymaths and people feeling lost.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"I wouldn't have discovered this hidden pattern running through my life if it weren't for AI helping me see it.\"\n/>\n\n## Niching Up, Not Down\n\nWhat also helped me—and might help you—is realizing that I don't fit into one box. For me, trying to niche down and put myself in smaller boxes was exactly the wrong approach.\n\nIt made me unhappy to think I had to do the same thing for the next 5-10 years. Instead of niching down, I niched up. This is what ChatGPT and other AI tools can do for us—help us see new perspectives and discover what's really important on a level that wasn't visible before.\n\nNow my purpose—\"I decode systems\"—isn't just a nice idea. It's something I can use to make my business even better. I've refined this into a clear mission: \"I decode systems—personal growth, money, marketing, AI—to help polymaths, lost souls, and entrepreneurs find clarity, purpose, and profit, drawing from my 25-year journey.\"\n\n## The 20-Minute AI Purpose-Finding Process\n\nI'm going to share my simple process that you can do with any large language model like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok. Here's how it works:\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"Watch the video for a visual demonstration of this process. I walk through each step and show real examples of how I used AI to discover my purpose.\"\n/>\n\n### Step 1: State Your Problem\n\nOpen your AI tool of choice and start by clearly stating your problem. Explain who you are, where you are in life, and what's troubling you.\n\nFor example, I mentioned that one of my problems was not being able to stick with anything for more than 3-6 months.\n\nTake 15-20 minutes to identify your pain points and passions:\n\n- Write down 3-5 moments where you felt lost, unfulfilled, or like an imposter\n- List 3-5 passions or skills you've pursued, even briefly\n\n### Example AI Prompts\n\nTry these prompts, inspired by my process:\n\n- **For career transitions:** \"I feel unfulfilled after [X years] of [roles/passions, e.g., coding, teaching]. Help me find my purpose—ask 3 questions, evaluate, and suggest a purpose tying my fears (e.g., imposter syndrome) and passions (e.g., music, tech).\"\n\n- **For multi-passionates:** \"I'm a multi-passionate feeling scattered—coding, writing, entrepreneurship. Ask 4 questions to uncover my purpose, focusing on overcoming my fear of not fitting one niche, and suggest a mission to help others like me.\"\n\n- **For new projects:** \"I want to launch [project, e.g., a YouTube channel] but feel like an imposter. Ask 3 questions, evaluate my answers, and suggest a purpose that uses my skills (e.g., AI, growth) to help [audience, e.g., lost folks].\"\n\n### Step 2: Ask for Expert Guidance\n\nAsk the AI what type of professionals could help you solve your problem:\n\n- \"Which professional consultant could help me?\"\n- \"What type of coach do you think could solve this riddle?\"\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"When the AI suggested an existential coach and systems consultant, these resonated with me more than the suggestion of a psychologist or therapist.\"\n/>\n\n### Step 3: Reframe Your Question\n\nAsk the AI to rewrite your prompt from the perspective of the experts that resonated with you. In my case, I asked it to include the existential coach and systems consultant perspectives.\n\nTry a prompt like this:\n\"I'm feeling lost after [X years] of [your roles/passions]. I want to find my purpose—ask me 3-5 questions, evaluate my answers, and suggest a purpose tying my fears (e.g., imposter syndrome) and passions together.\"\n\n### Step 4: Share Your Backstory\n\nGive the AI your complete background—all the things you've done in your life that seem disconnected. The more details you provide, the better the AI can identify patterns.\n\nBe vulnerable here. Share both your failures (like my SaaS company tanking) and your wins (like scaling events). Authenticity is key to getting meaningful insights.\n\n### Step 5: Ask for Patterns\n\nAsk directly: \"What patterns can you see that I've overlooked? What's the overarching theme in my life?\"\n\nFor me, the AI described me as a polymath who thrives at intersections. This resonated deeply.\n\n### Step 6: Request Different Perspectives\n\nAsk the AI to describe your purpose from different perspectives. I asked it to describe my purpose as a CEO might, and that's when it came up with \"systems decoder\"—which instantly clicked.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"The entire process took me about 20 minutes—just the time it took to walk from dropping my son at childcare back to my home.\"\n/>\n\n### Step 7: Refine Your Purpose\n\nTake 15-20 minutes to use your AI insights to craft a personal purpose statement:\n\n1. Review your AI responses and notes—highlight recurring themes\n2. Write a purpose statement: \"I [verb] [systems or areas] to help [audience] [benefit]\"\n3. Test it—does it feel true, like my \"I decode systems to help polymaths live free\"?\n\n## Your Purpose as a North Star\n\nYour purpose serves as your North Star, helping you make better decisions. Not knowing what you want can actually be a superpower because you're aware of it and free to explore what should come next.\n\nRemember that feeling lost is often just your subconscious mind telling you that you aren't where you belong. That awareness is the first step toward finding your true path.\n\n## The Power of AI for Self-Discovery\n\nI use ChatGPT and similar tools every day for self-reflection and exploration. They provide an external perspective that can reveal patterns we're too close to see ourselves.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"AI doesn't replace human insight—it enhances it by showing us perspectives we might never have considered on our own.\"\n/>\n\n## Your Turn to Find Your Purpose\n\nNow it's up to you. Take 20 minutes to try this process:\n\n1. State your problem clearly\n2. Ask which experts could help you\n3. Reframe your question from their perspective\n4. Share your complete backstory\n5. Ask for patterns you've missed\n6. Request different perspectives on your purpose\n7. Refine your purpose into a clear statement\n\nI've created a framework document with prompts you can use (check the description below the video).\n\nHere are some additional AI prompts you can try, inspired by my process:\n\n- \"I feel unfulfilled after [X years] of [roles/passions]. Help me find my purpose—ask 3 questions, evaluate, and suggest a purpose tying my fears and passions together.\"\n- \"I'm a polymath feeling scattered—[list your interests]. Ask 4 questions to uncover my purpose, focusing on overcoming my fear of not fitting one niche, and suggest a mission to help others like me.\"\n- \"I want to launch [project] but feel like an imposter. Ask 3 questions, evaluate my answers, and suggest a purpose that uses my skills to help [audience].\"\n\n## What's Next After Finding Your Purpose?\n\nFinding your purpose is just the beginning. Once you have your North Star, you can:\n\n1. Evaluate current projects against your purpose\n2. Make decisions with greater confidence\n3. Find connections between seemingly unrelated interests\n4. Explain your unique value to others more clearly\n\nTake action to test your purpose:\n\n- Start a small project tied to your purpose (like I did with \"I Decode Systems\" on YouTube)\n- Share your purpose with 3-5 people and ask for feedback\n- Track responses and adjust as needed\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"Having decoded my own purpose as a systems decoder, I now apply this lens to everything I do—from wealth building to personal development.\"\n/>\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nYour purpose isn't set in stone. It may evolve as you grow and gain new experiences. The important thing is having that North Star to guide your decisions today.\n\nRemember these tips from my journey:\n\n- Be vulnerable: Share both failures and successes\n- Stay curious: Keep exploring your passions\n- Use AI as a mirror: It's a tool to unlock your own insights\n- Test locally: Start with friends to validate your purpose\n\nTake the time to discover yours. Watch this video again if needed, use my prompts, and see what insights emerge. Your future self will thank you for the clarity this process brings.\n\nHave you discovered your purpose or North Star?

How come so many people struggle to put money aside?\n\nThere has been a good reason in recent years: Inflation. While this is a solid argument, savings haven't been high before inflation. Now we can point somewhere and tell ourselves: \"I can't save! It's the inflation!\"\n\nSaving money is one of the most essential skills. It often means giving up smoking, alcohol, sweets, or that treat you \"deserve.\" What remains unseen is that saving money is an investment in a better life.\n\n> **Struggling with bad money habits?** Check out [5 Money Habits That Keep You Poor](/5-money-habits-that-keep-you-poor-even-with-a-high-income) and [10 Signs You're Bad With Money](/10-signs-youre-bad-with-money-and-how-to-change-that) to identify behaviors that might be holding you back.\n\n## Why Should You Start Saving Money in 2025?\n\nLet me share a personal story about when I learned the hard way why saving is crucial.\n\nIn 2016, I was broke. After quitting my job in 2015, I started a company with a friend. A few bad decisions and bad luck led to a complete disaster. At some point, I didn't know how to pay the rent for my apartment.\n\nA friend asked how to promote his personal training business. I shared my knowledge of homepages, landing pages, email marketing, and Facebook Ads. After our three-hour dinner, my friend said one simple sentence that changed my life:\n\n<InfoBox type=\"info\" content=\"This is amazing Why again not taking money for this?\" />\n\nThat was when I realized I had a valuable skill. So, I decided to become a self-employed digital marketing advisor. After my first project, I vowed never to experience that again, so I pledged to save money.\n\n**My goal:** live a year without new customers. I achieved this in 6 months, changing everything.\n\nThat experience taught me that saving money isn't just about having more—it's about gaining freedom and peace of mind. The true path to financial freedom.\n\n## Benefits of Saving Money\n\n### 1. Freedom of Choice\n\nWorking self-employed isn't always sunshine. Some customers are horrible and the type of people I don't want to spend time with. My savings allowed me to be picky, but being picky is more difficult when you need the money. That's why people work in jobs they hate and endure bosses they can't stand.\n\nBy creating a financial buffer, you are gaining freedom. When you have enough money saved, you can tell your supervisor to treat you nicely or leave the scene.\n\n### 2. Better Retirement Planning\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  title=\"Retirement Reality Check\"\n  content=\"I am from Germany, and we have a good social security net, but I don't trust it. This system was created when few lived past 70. Today, with life expectancy at 87, we're discussing if retirement at 64 is reasonable.\"\n/>\n\nTwo things will likely happen:\n\n- We have to pay more for retirement\n- You will receive less for your retirement\n\nPrepare smartly for yourself; your dignity depends on planning.\n\nSaving money brings freedom of choice.\n\nWorking self-employed isn't always sunshine. Some customers are horrible and the type of people I don't want to spend time with. My savings allowed me to be picky, but being picky is more difficult when you need the money. That's why people work in jobs they hate and endure bosses they can't stand.\n\nBy creating a financial buffer, you are gaining freedom. When you have enough money saved, you can tell your supervisor to treat you nicely or leave the scene.\n\nWhile financial freedom today is vital, planning for the future is just as important.\n\n## Saving money makes dreams come true\n\nAre you familiar with the marshmallow experiment? Five-year-olds were asked to resist a marshmallow. If successful, they would get a second one.\n\nThe same is true for saving money: That's your marshmallow today. Spending money on those fancy gadgets? Getting drunk with friends? Spending money on that thing you \"deserve\"?\n\nInstant gratification, like \"Amazon same-day delivery,\" exemplifies poor money management. Learn to delay it to surpass your peers.\n\nThis is beneficial not just for you, but also for your loved ones. You can be the friend, parent, or spouse who provides and takes responsibility. Nothing feels worse than a parent who can't ensure a good life for their loved ones.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"Peace of Mind\"\n  content=\"Saving money prepares you for negative events. Nobody knows what's going to happen next. Are we on the brink of a new Covid-19? Will there be another economic downturn? Will you get sick? Burnout? We don't know. That's why saving money equals peace of mind.\"\n/>\n\nSaving money isn't just about numbers—it's also about mindset.\n\n## What do you think about money - Your Money Mindset\n\nMoney is delicate: Without it, we may feel like failures. With it, we might feel guilty. Money amplifies our existing beliefs, for better or worse. Thus, it's essential to examine our beliefs.\n\nWe must examine our relationship with money and our desires. Neglecting its power while focusing solely on it is unwise. Both mindsets have unique shortcomings. Money's emotional power links directly to our ingrained self-perceptions.\n\n- Do I feel like a valuable human?\n- What do you think you deserve?\n- What is my time worth?\n\nMoney's role in our lives is significant, as we live in a capitalist system where we trade value—time, resources, knowledge—for money. If money equals value, it's understandable we tie our worth to it.\n\nBefore losing myself over money—worth an article on its own—let's focus on you. I have a little exercise for you.

If you think money is bad, why would it come to you? Believing money is bad causes avoidance, leading to unhappiness and poverty — a state I'd prefer to avoid.\n\n<InfoBox type=\"info\" content=\"I'd rather be rich and miserable than poor and miserable - Unknown\" />\n\n## When should I consider saving money?\n\nIn short? Immediately. Don't waste time until the next month. Don't wait until you get the next raise. Otherwise, it's like a New Year resolution, and we all know too well how that ends.\n\nThe following steps help you to decide where you are and what you should do next:\n\n### Get Your Life in Order: Take control of your finances today\n\n- Track Income and Expenses: Know where your money is going.\n- Pay for Necessities: Focus on rent/mortgage, food, utilities, transportation, and healthcare.\n- Do It Online: Visit canvas.dennistroeger.com to manage your budget—it takes 15 minutes!\n\n### Build an Emergency Fund\n\nBe prepared for unexpected expenses:\n\n- Quick Access: Ensure it's money you can access within 48 hours, with minimal risk.\n- Starter Goal: Save $1,000 or one month's expenses.\n- Long-Term Goal: Grow it to cover 3-6 months of living costs.\n\n### Maximize Employer Benefits\n\n- 401(k) Contributions: Contribute enough to get the full employer match—it's free money!\n\n### Pay Off Debt\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"Tackle high-interest debt using the Avalanche (highest first) or Snowball (smallest first) method, focusing on debts above 5%, especially over 10%.\"\n/>\n\n### Increase Retirement Savings\n\n- Aim for 15%: Save at least 15% of your pre-tax income in retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.\n\n### Plan for Future Goals\n\n- Big Expenses: Start funding future needs like education, a new car, or a home.\n- Health Savings Account (HSA): Max out if eligible.\n- College Savings: Contribute to your kids' education if desired.\n\n### Invest and Plan for the Future\n\n- Beyond Retirement: Use taxable investment accounts for long-term goals.\n- Personal Priorities: Balance savings based on your values.\n\nOnce you've laid the groundwork, it's time to explore techniques that make saving simpler.\n\n## 3 Ways to Save More Money\n\n### #1 Save at the beginning of the month\n\nSaving money is difficult. Our brains struggle against cheap dopamine or instant gratification. Survival instincts don't plan for retirement. Planning was irrelevant in the Stone Age.\n\n<InfoBox type=\"info\" content=\"💡Read more about when spending is completely fine here.\" />\n\nTo simplify, set up monthly payments to your savings account right after receiving your paycheck. Discuss options with your employer. A 401k could also be beneficial.\n\n### #2 Earn more\n\n\"How can I earn more?\" I understand; you've likely pondered this. Yet, this question is flawed as it centers solely on you. It neglects the role of others. Concepts like IKIGAI can shift your focus outward.\n\nBefore diving into complex models, ask: What can I offer? If you feel stuck, consult a friend, spouse, or co-worker about your strengths.\n\nI write because a friend said, \"Nobody helped me with personal finance as you do. You should help others, too!\". The question \"How can I earn more money?\" never leads to an answer.\n\n### #3 Best budgeting apps for beginners to save money\n\nWe all have unnecessary expenses. I could save $500 a month if I stopped buying books I don't read! While I don't want to call books \"unnecessary,\" it's an area where I could be more mindful.\n\nAdditionally, I'm sure some expenses can be reduced or eliminated. \"But, Dennis, I already spend only what I need.\" Perhaps, but I can't judge your situation. If that's true, refer to #2 and consider earning more money.\n\nWhat benefited me was utilizing \"Finanzguru\" (Finance Guru), a German budgeting app.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  title=\"Tracking Tip\"\n  content=\"But I don't want to track all my expenses. That's exhausting! - Start by tracking one day, then a week, and maybe a month. This will show where your money goes in a typical month. We can only change what we can measure—this applies to everyone, not just managers.\"\n/>\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"💡Are you financially literate?

If savings are under $1,000, keep it in cash in a savings account, ideally for amounts up to $10,000 or six months' expenses. This offers flexibility for life's challenges.\n\nAs a U.S. resident, consider a Roth IRA or 401k beneficial. Since these subjects deserve more attention, I'll keep it brief for now. A Roth IRA allows tax-free withdrawals, providing financial security for the future regulations.\n\n### ETF - Exchange Traded Funds\n\nThese are like fruit baskets of stocks. By now, you've likely heard of ETFs. If not, check out great articles and videos (start here).\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  title=\"TER Tip\"\n  content=\"It's crucial to select an ETF that is affordable. Here, affordable refers to a TER of less than 0.50%, which indicates the annual fees you pay for holding the ETF. This is how the ETF generates revenue. Aim for a TER below 0.30%, though this may vary by investment.\"\n/>\n\n\"0,2% is a lot!\" - Yes, and no. This roughly equals $200 on $100,000 savings a year. When you reach these numbers, $200 is part of the normal fluctuation. I see it differently, but I like my life easy and don't want to count every penny. More about finding the right ETF you can find here.\n\n### Stocks\n\nAh, indeed... stocks. Why not bypass the middlemen and invest directly in stocks? The prospect of becoming a self-made millionaire is appealing. Even with a 60-hour work week, 96% of professional fund managers do not surpass ETF performance.\n\nDo you think you can do better? I encourage you to check my Wealth Triangle, which shows how much to invest based on your risk profile.\n\n<a\n  href=\"/wealth-triangle\"\n  class=\"inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full border-[#7A4EFF] border bg-[#7A4EFF] font-medium text-center text-base leading-snug transition py-3.5 px-6 md:px-8 ease-in duration-200 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-blue-200 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 hover:bg-secondary hover:border-secondary hover:text-white dark:text-white dark:bg-primary dark:border-primary dark:hover:border-secondary dark:hover:bg-secondary\"\n>\n  <span style=\"color: white !important;\">Check the Wealth Triangle</span>\n  <Icon name=\"tabler:external-link\" class=\"w-5 h-5 ml-1 -mr-1.5 rtl:mr-1 rtl:-ml-1.5 inline-block text-white\" />\n</a>\n\nBy now, you've seen the impact that mindful saving can have.\n\n## Saving Money - A summary\n\nSaving money is vital for control and autonomy in life. It's a crucial skill that helps you be a happy human being. The number of people who live from paycheck to paycheck is staggering.\n\nLearning to manage money should start early.

One of them has already collapsed - yes, you read that right. Despite knowing that success rates are low and returns can take years, I still love being an angel investor. Why? Because it's not just about the money. It's about helping entrepreneurs grow their businesses and being part of exciting new ideas.\n\nBut before you get excited about finding the next unicorn startup, let's talk about what angel investing really means and if it's right for you. I'll share both my experience and the hard data to help you make an informed decision.\n\nWhat Is an Angel Investor?\n\nAn angel investor is typically a high-net-worth individual who provides capital for startups in exchange for equity. But it's more than just writing checks. Angel investors often:\n\n- Invest their own money (unlike venture capitalists who manage funds)\n- Get involved early in a company's life\n- Provide expertise and connections, not just money\n- Take high risks for potentially high returns\n\nThe Path to Becoming an Angel Investor\n\nStep 1: Qualify Financially\n\nIn most countries, you need to be an \"accredited investor,\" which typically means:\n\n- Annual income over $200,000 ($300,000 with spouse)\n- Net worth over $1 million (excluding primary residence)\n- Professional investment experience\n\nStep 2: Build Your Knowledge Base\n\nBefore investing a cent:\n\n- Study startup economics\n- Learn about term sheets and valuations\n- Understand cap tables\n- Get familiar with due diligence processes\n\nStep 3: Start Networking\n\nConnect with the startup ecosystem:\n\n- Join angel investment groups\n- Attend startup pitch events\n- Network with other angels\n- Build relationships with accelerators\n\nThe Hard Numbers First\n\nLet me be honest: I started angel investing knowing these sobering statistics, and my experience so far (with one failed investment) confirms them:\n\n- 52% of all exits return less than the invested capital\n- Only 7% of exits achieve returns of more than 10x\n- The average return is 2.6 times your money in 3.5 years\n\nBut here's the thing: While the numbers matter, they're not the only reason to become an angel investor. For me, being part of innovative solutions and helping entrepreneurs achieve their dreams adds value beyond just financial returns.\n\nSize Matters (A Lot)\n\nHere's what happens based on how many companies you invest in:\n\n- 1-5 companies: Median return of 0% (yes, zero)\n- 10 companies: 6% return, but 32% chance of losing money\n- 20 companies: 7% return, with 16% chance of losing money\n- 50 companies: 10% return, with 11% chance of losing money\n\nSee the pattern? You need a big portfolio to make this work.\n\nTime Is More Than Money\n\nWant better returns? You need to work for them:\n\n- Less than 20 hours on due diligence: 1.1x return\n- More than 20 hours: 5.9x return\n- More than 40 hours: 7.1x return\n\nAnd that's just the start. Regular interaction with your portfolio companies (about twice a month) can triple your returns compared to occasional check-ins.\n\nGetting Started as an Angel Investor\n\n1. Education First\n\n- Take angel investing courses\n- Read books on startup investing\n- Follow experienced angels online\n- Study successful and failed investments\n\n2. Start Small\n\n- Join an angel syndicate\n- Invest alongside experienced angels\n- Make small initial investments\n- Learn from each deal\n\n3. Build Your Process\n\n- Create an investment thesis\n- Develop due diligence checklists\n- Set clear investment criteria\n- Plan your portfolio strategy\n\nThe Real Requirements for Angel Investing\n\nBefore you start, ask yourself:\n\n1.  Do you have enough capital?\n\n- Can you invest in at least 20 companies?\n- Can you afford to lose it all?\n- Do you have additional funds for follow-on investments?\n\n1.  Do you have the time?\n\n- 40+ hours per investment for due diligence\n- Regular meetings with portfolio companies\n- Networking and deal flow development\n\n1.  Do you have relevant expertise?\n\n- Industry knowledge\n- Business evaluation skills\n- Network for deal flow\n\nWhen Angel Investing Makes Sense\n\nConsider becoming an angel investor if:\n\n- You can afford to invest in 20+ companies\n- You have expertise in specific industries\n- You can dedicate significant time\n- You understand and accept the high risk\n- You have a long-term horizon (5-10 years)\n\nWhen to Stay Away\n\nAngel investing isn't for you if:\n\n- You can't diversify across many investments\n- You need the money back within 5 years\n- You can't afford to lose the investment\n- You don't have time for due diligence\n- You're looking for steady returns\n\nHow to Get Your First Deal\n\n1.  Join Angel Groups\n\n- Local angel investment networks\n- Online platforms like AngelList\n- Industry-specific investor groups\n\n1.  Build Your Deal Flow\n\n- Attend startup pitching events\n- Connect with accelerators\n- Network with other angels\n- Engage with startup communities\n\n1.  Start Due Diligence\n\n- Verify the team's background\n- Analyze the market opportunity\n- Review financial projections\n- Check legal documentation\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAngel investing can be rewarding, but it's not a passive investment strategy. The average returns (around 2.5x over 4.5 years) might sound attractive, but remember this includes the rare massive wins that offset many losses.\n\nIf you're still interested, start small:\n\n1.  Join an angel investment group\n2.  Learn from experienced investors\n3.  Start with small investments\n4.  Build your portfolio gradually\n5.  Focus on industries you understand\n\nRemember: The S&P 500 has often outperformed angel investing portfolios with far less work and risk. Make sure you're in it for the right reasons - not just the potential returns.\n\nWant to explore other investment options first?

One day you're living your normal life, and the next you're managing a sum of money you've never dealt with before. While this windfall can open new doors, it can also lead to costly mistakes if you're not careful.\n\nI've seen many people struggle after receiving an inheritance. Here are the five biggest mistakes you need to avoid to protect your newfound wealth.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"**Need a step-by-step plan?** Check out my guide on [Your First 30 Days After Inheriting Money](/your-first-30-days-after-inheriting-money-a-step-by-step-guide) for a practical timeline of what to do.\"\n/>\n\n## 1. Trusting Bank Advisors Without Question\n\nYour bank might seem like the natural place to go for financial advice. But here's the truth: bank advisors often push their own products first. They work for the bank, not for you. Their job is to sell bank services, even if those aren't the best choice for your situation.\n\nLet me share a real example: A client recently showed me a bank's investment proposal. They wanted a 3-5% advisor fee, a 5% initial sales charge when buying funds, and another 5% exit fee when selling. On a €100,000 inheritance, that means $3,000 gone in advisor fees alone. Add the one-time fees, and you're losing $8,000 in the first year – before you earned one Dollar. Not to mention the exit fee...\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  content=\"This is crazy. I've seen too many people lose money by blindly following bank advice. Instead, consider working with an independent financial advisor who can look at all your options, not just one bank's products.\"\n/>\n\n## 2. Falling for FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\n\nWe've all heard stories about someone's cousin who doubled their money in crypto, or a friend who made it big in real estate. These success stories can make you feel like you're missing out.\n\nBut here's what people don't share: their losses. Nobody posts on social media about their failed investments or costly mistakes. Remember, chasing other people's success stories is a quick way to lose your inheritance.\n\nEnsure you understand which asset types feel good for you and fit your risk-type. For me, real estate always felt like a burden; for others, it's THE thing.\n\n## 3. Not Understanding Your Risk Profile\n\nEveryone has a different comfort level with money and risk. For some, losing $10,000 in the market feels devastating. For others, it's just a normal day of trading.\n\nThe key is knowing yourself. There's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" risk level – there's only what works for you. Your comfort with risk might even change over time. When I started investing, a $100 loss felt huge. Now, I'm comfortable with my portfolio moving thousands of dollars up or down in a day.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"Know where you are right now and plan accordingly. Your risk tolerance should guide your investment decisions, not the other way around.\"\n/>\n\n## 4. The Investment Zigzag\n\nPicture trying to drive to a new city without GPS. You'd waste time and gas going back and forth, never sure if you're heading the right way. That's what investing without a strategy looks like.\n\nMany people zigzag with their inheritance: buying stocks one day, selling in panic the next, then trying real estate, then going back to stocks. Then they add a bit of crypto...\n\nWithout a clear plan, every direction feels wrong because you have no true destination in mind.\n\n## 5. Playing in the Wrong League\n\nHere's a mistake I see all the time: people with $100,000 trying to copy the investment strategies of millionaires. It's like trying to play major league baseball when you're still learning to bat.\n\nDifferent amounts of money need different strategies. Someone with $1 million has more room for error and can take bigger risks. They can lose 10% ($100,000) and still be okay. But if you lose 10% of $100,000, that's a much bigger hit to your financial security.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"The Bottom Line\"\n  content=\"Inheriting money is a huge responsibility. By avoiding these five mistakes, you'll be better prepared to protect and grow your inheritance. Remember: this is your journey. Don't let others pressure you into decisions that don't feel right for you.\"\n/>\n\n## What To Do Instead\n\nOnce you've avoided these common pitfalls, you'll need a solid plan for your inheritance. Consider these resources:\n\n- Learn about [the Wealth Triangle framework](/wealth-triangle) to structure your inheritance for both security and growth\n- If you're considering investing, read [How to Start Investing in 2025](/how-to-start-investing-in-2025) for beginner-friendly advice\n- Use [the Wealth Canvas](/the-wealth-canvas-a-new-way-to-see-your-money-journey) to visualize how your inheritance fits into your overall financial picture\n\n<Timeline\n  items={[\n    {\n      title: 'First 30 Days',\n      description: 'Take time to grieve and process.

Take your time, seek qualified advice, and make decisions that align with your long-term goals. By avoiding these five common mistakes, you're already ahead of most people who receive an inheritance.\n\nYour inheritance can be a foundation for financial security and growth if managed wisely.

Can always sell if it doesn't work\"\n- Unexpected Money: \"What's trending right now?\"\n- Friend's Tip: \"Already bought it last week\"\n\nPerfect Wealth Triangle Distribution\n\n- Foundation: 10% (Just enough to feel secure)\n- Growth: 50% (Growth stocks and emerging markets)\n- Opportunity: 40% (High-risk, high-reward investments)\n\nSuccess Strategies\n\n- Implement strict stop-loss rules\n- Keep a trading journal to track decision quality\n- Maintain a core portfolio alongside trading positions\n- Set clear profit-taking targets\n\n🐢 The Steady Tortoise: The Conservative Builder\n\nHow They Think Remember the story of the tortoise and the hare? The Steady Tortoise is living it. They're the ones who've been maxing out their retirement accounts since their first job and probably still have their childhood piggy bank. I love working with Tortoises because they teach me patience - one of my Tortoise clients turned $100 monthly savings into a substantial nest egg over 30 years.\n\nNatural Habitat\n\n- Dividend aristocrats\n- High-yield savings accounts\n- Municipal bonds\n- Blue-chip value stocks\n- Real estate rental income\n\nPerfect Wealth Triangle Distribution\n\n- Foundation: 30% (High-yield savings and bonds)\n- Growth: 65% (Index funds and dividend stocks)\n- Opportunity: 5% (Very selective high-risk investments)\n\nSuccess Strategies\n\n- Consider slightly more growth-oriented assets\n- Learn about inflation-protected investments\n- Explore automated investment tools\n- Set milestone rewards for reaching goals\n\n🦊 The Clever Fox: The Adaptive Strategist\n\nHow They Think The Fox is like the Swiss Army knife of investors - adaptable, strategic, and always thinking ahead. They understand both the Owl's need for research and the Cheetah's appetite for opportunity. One of my Fox clients perfectly balanced their portfolio between stable dividend stocks and emerging tech investments, creating a self-sustaining wealth machine.\n\nTypical Reactions\n\n- Market Drop: \"Which sectors will recover first?\"\n- New Opportunity: \"How does this fit my overall strategy?\"\n- Unexpected Money: \"Time to rebalance and optimize\"\n- Friend's Tip: \"Let me see how this connects to current trends\"\n\nPerfect Wealth Triangle Distribution\n\n- Foundation: 15% (Smart emergency fund)\n- Growth: 65% (Mix of growth and value investments)\n- Opportunity: 20% (Calculated high-risk positions)\n\nSuccess Strategies\n\n- Keep a core-satellite portfolio approach\n- Regular strategy reviews\n- Maintain investment journals\n- Network with other investors\n\n🦁 The Brave Lion: The Bold Risk-Taker\n\nHow They Think Lions aren't afraid to roar - or in this case, take big financial risks. They're the ones who might put 50% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies or bet big on a single stock. While this can lead to impressive gains, it can also mean significant losses. I had a Lion client who turned $10,000 into $100,000 with crypto investments, but another who learned some expensive lessons in risk management.\n\nNatural Habitat\n\n- High-conviction stock positions\n- Cryptocurrencies\n- Angel investments\n- Leveraged positions\n- Emerging markets\n\nPerfect Wealth Triangle Distribution\n\n- Foundation: 5% (Minimal safety net)\n- Growth: 45% (Aggressive growth stocks)\n- Opportunity: 50% (High-risk, speculative investments)\n\nSuccess Strategies\n\n- Set maximum position sizes\n- Keep some assets in safer investments\n- Learn about hedging strategies\n- Develop exit plans before entering positions\n\nThe Reality: Types Are Fluid, Not Fixed\n\nYour investment type isn't a lifetime sentence. Life changes, and so do we. A Brave Lion at 25 might become a Wise Owl at 35 after having kids, or a Steady Tortoise might discover their inner Cheetah after building a solid financial foundation.\n\nWhat influences type changes?\n\n- Age and life stage\n- Having children\n- Career changes\n- Past experiences (both good and bad)\n- Market experiences\n- Overall wealth level\n- Life goals and dreams\n\nMaking It Work For You\n\nThe real value in knowing your type comes from:\n\n1.  Understanding your natural tendencies\n2.  Spotting potential blind spots\n3.  Creating a suitable Wealth Triangle distribution\n4.  Making decisions that let you sleep at night\n\nRemember: There's no \"best\" type - only the best way to work with your natural tendencies. Your goal should be building a wealth strategy that matches your personality while moving you toward your financial goals.\n\nWant to know your type? Ask yourself:\n\n- How do you feel about market volatility?\n- What's your research process before investing?\n- How quickly do you make financial decisions?\n- What risks are you comfortable with?\n\nWhat's your Money Spirit Animal?

Are you:\n\n- Saving for retirement in 30 years?\n- Planning to buy a house in 5 years?\n- Building wealth for your children?\n- Creating an additional income stream?\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  content=\"The longer your investment horizon, the more risk you can typically accept. This is because you have more time to recover from market downturns.\"\n/>\n\n### Life Stage Planning\n\nYour age and life stage matter more than most people think:\n\n- **In your 20s?** You might be able to take more risks and recover from mistakes\n- **In your 40s with kids?** You might need more stability\n- **Approaching retirement?** You'll want to focus more on wealth preservation\n\n### Future Life Changes\n\nThink about potential future events:\n\n- Marriage or children?\n- Career changes?\n- Moving to a different country?\n- Starting a business?\n- Inheriting money?\n\nEach of these events might require different investment approaches.\n\n### Your Real Risk Tolerance\n\nBe honest with yourself:\n\n- Can you sleep when markets drop 20%?\n- Do you need regular access to your money?\n- How would a 30% loss affect your life?\n- What's your actual financial buffer?\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  title=\"Risk Reality Check\"\n  content=\"Many investors overestimate their risk tolerance until they experience their first major market downturn. Be conservative in your self-assessment.\"\n/>\n\n## Building Your Investment Strategy\n\nOnce you understand your personal investment profile, it's time to build a strategy that works for you.\n\n### The Foundation: Have Savings First\n\nBefore you start investing, make sure you have adequate savings. [Learn how to save money effectively](/how-to-save-money) if you haven't built this foundation yet. As a general rule, aim to have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing significant amounts.\n\n### Choosing the Right Investment Vehicles\n\nFor most beginners, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) offer an excellent starting point. They provide diversification, low fees, and simplicity. Not sure which one to pick? Check out my guide on [how to choose the right ETF in 2025](/how-to-choose-the-right-etf-in-2025-a-simple-guide-for-anxious-and-curious-investors).\n\n### Structuring Your Investments\n\nConsider using frameworks like [the Wealth Triangle](/wealth-triangle) to structure your investments according to your risk tolerance and goals. This approach helps you balance security, growth, and opportunity in your portfolio.\n\nFor a more comprehensive view of your financial journey, [the Wealth Canvas](/the-wealth-canvas-a-new-way-to-see-your-money-journey) can help you visualize how your investments fit into your overall financial picture.\n\n## The Simple Approach to ETF Investing\n\nLet me be straight with you: Most people overcomplicate ETF investing. I know because I've been there. After years of experience and some expensive lessons, I've learned that simpler is usually better. Here's my no-nonsense guide to ETF investing.\n\n### The One-ETF Approach: Why I Keep It Simple\n\nI use one ETF: Vanguard All-World. That's it. No fancy combinations, no sector bets, no emerging market splits. Just one broad market ETF that covers the world's largest companies.\n\n\"But what about diversification?\" you might ask. Here's the thing: A world ETF already gives you:\n\n- Multiple countries\n- Various industries\n- Different company sizes\n- Natural risk spreading\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"Simplicity Wins\"\n  content=\"A single world ETF can provide all the diversification most investors need. Complexity rarely improves returns but often increases costs and stress.\"\n/>\n\n### Learning From My Mistakes (So You Don't Have To)\n\nWhen I started, I thought I could outsmart the market. Spoiler alert: I couldn't. I tried picking sector ETFs, thinking I knew which industries would outperform. This cost me returns and peace of mind.\n\n**Common Mistake Alert:** Many investors think they can have both high returns AND complete safety. Here's the truth: You can't. You either get:\n\n- Higher probability of steady returns (lower risk)\n- Higher potential returns (higher risk)\n\nBut you can't have both. Anyone who tells you different is selling something.\n\n### How Many ETFs Do You Really Need?\n\nMy answer? One to five, maximum. Here's why:\n\n- One ETF can give you global coverage\n- More ETFs mean more complexity\n- More complexity means more decisions\n- More decisions mean more chances to make mistakes\n\n## Making Smart Investment Choices\n\n### Choosing Your ETF: What Really Matters\n\nFocus on these key factors:\n\n1. **Total Expense Ratio (TER)**\n   - Lower is better\n2. **Fund size**\n   - Bigger is generally safer\n3. **Provider reputation**\n   - I prefer Vanguard, but iShares and Fidelity are solid too\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"info\"\n  title=\"TER Matters\"\n  content=\"Even a small difference in expense ratio can significantly impact your returns over time. A 0.1% vs 0.3% difference might not seem like much, but on a 30-year investment, it could cost you thousands.\"\n/>\n\n### The US Dominance \"Problem\"\n\nPeople often worry about US stocks dominating world ETFs. My take? I'm actually fine with it. Here's why:\n\n- Most major global companies are US-based\n- These companies operate worldwide anyway\n- US markets are highly regulated and transparent\n\n## Handling Market Volatility\n\n### Dealing with Market Downturns\n\nHere's the hardest truth: You will see your investment drop. Maybe 20%, maybe more. My advice:\n\n1. **Start Small**\n\n   - Don't dump your entire inheritance into ETFs at once\n   - Start with smaller amounts to get used to market movements\n   - Remember: A 2% drop on €1,000 feels very different from a 2% drop on €100,000\n\n2. **Set and (Try to) Forget**\n   - I'll be honest - I'm terrible at this myself\n   - I check my portfolio too often\n   - Don't be like me\n   - Set up automatic investments and check less frequently\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"warning\"\n  title=\"Psychology Matters\"\n  content=\"The biggest obstacle to investment success isn't market performance—it's investor behavior. Checking your portfolio too frequently leads to emotional decisions and poor returns.\"\n/>\n\n### My Future Strategy\n\nI'm young now, so I'm 100% in stocks through my world ETF. But here's my plan:\n\n- Continue with this strategy for the next 10-12 years\n- Start adding bonds as I approach 45\n- Gradually increase bond allocation for more stability\n\n## Your Action Plan\n\n1. Choose one broad market ETF (like Vanguard All-World)\n2. Set up a monthly investment plan\n3. Start small and increase gradually\n4. Resist the urge to check daily\n5. Ignore market \"experts\" predicting crashes\n\nWant to see how your ETF investment might grow? Try my ETF Growth Calculator to play with different scenarios.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nETF investing doesn't need to be complicated. First, understand your personal situation and goals. Then, choose one solid world ETF, make regular investments, and have patience - that's really all you need. Everything else is just noise.\n\n<InfoBox\n  type=\"success\"\n  title=\"Consistency Is Key\"\n  content=\"Remember: The best investment strategy isn't the one that could make you the most money - it's the one you can actually stick with through good times and bad.\"\n/>\n\nWant to learn more about building your wealth step by step?

A few years ago, I was sitting at my desk, staring at a spreadsheet filled with numbers. Should I keep my money in the bank? Invest it in stocks? Buy crypto? The options felt endless, and the lack of clarity was overwhelming. Should I keep it all in the bank? Invest it in stocks? Buy crypto? It was overwhelming. That's when I came up with a simple system: the Money Triangle.\n\nNot all money is equal: Having money in a bank account is different from money tied up in real estate. Liquidity refers to how quickly assets can be converted to cash without significant loss in value, while risk represents the potential for financial loss. Understanding these dimensions is critical in financial planning because it influences how prepared you are for emergencies and how much flexibility you have to seize new opportunities.\n\n> **New to financial concepts?** Start with [mastering financial literacy](/financial-literacy) to build a strong foundation for using this framework.\n\nMany homeowners \"feel\" poor: If they have to pay $30.000 for a new heater, they can't \"simply sell\" parts of the house - they need cash in order to pay the bills. This is why many people advise you to have at least 3 to 6 months of monthly income as cash in your bank account. Nobody wants to sell his return investment to pay a bill. That simply isn't fun.\n\nThe Money Triangle has three tiers:\n\n- The Foundation\n- Growth Zone\n- Opportunity Zone\n\nThe Money Triangle tries to satisfy all needs when it comes to money: Security & Growth & FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). We all want security, but how much security is necessary depends heavily on the type of person.\n\nThe Foundation\n\nIt's the safe harbor for us to pay the bills and manage life in front of us. It helps to keep us calm and gives us freedom. Having money in the Foundation Zone empowers you to choose which customers to serve (if you are self-employed) or even quit your job if you are treated unfairly.\n\nA buffer of 3-6 months provides peace of mind and prepares you for sudden expenses - like a broken washing machine or an unexpected tax payment. Here, 5-10% of your wealth should be parked. Low return, low risk, low volatility. Save.\n\n> **Need help building your foundation?** Learn [how to save money effectively](/how-to-save-money) to establish this crucial first tier.\n\nThe Growth Zone\n\nThe second tier of the Wealth Triangle is the Growh Zone: Here we want to make sure our money grows with reasonable risk with reasonable returns. Usually, that's an MSCI World or equal ETF. Investing in an ETF like this will never make you brag on a party about how you got a new Ferarri.\n\nBut it also won't make you bankrupt. The growth zone makes sure you feel safe and prepare for your future and retirement. It also focuses on building the house you have always dreamed about. You shouldn't expect high returns here (usually 5-8% p.a. the last 50 years) - but this means your money roughly doubles every 10 - 14 years. This should make something about 50 - 85 % of your money, depending on your risk tolerance.\n\nThe Opportunity Zone\n\nThe Opportunity Zone is the \"fun\" and \"dangerous\" place. This is the money you put into Bitcoin, your friend's company, and high-risk stocks - it equals going to the casino. This money should be considered gone the second you invest it. Not because you will always pick the wrong asset, but to make sure you never invest the money you need. Again, Consider it gone. Usually, 15 - 45% of your money should be allocated here.\n\nThe Money Triangle is highly personal: What suits me won't suit you. Over time ,I discovered for that my triangle is:\n\n3% Foundation 82% Growth 15% Opportunity\n\nThis means at all times, I am prepared to lose 15% of my wealth in an instant. I wouldn't be happy, but I wouldn't be devastated. I learned this the hard way: I invested 40.000 EUR into a friend's company. They went bankrupt 4 years later. I never got any money back. I never regretted my investment because it was part of my danger zone. This money is treated differently.\n\nBreaking Down My 3-82-15 Approach\n\nThe Foundation: Safety First (3%)\n\nThink of this as the bedrock of your financial plan—the portion that lets you sleep soundly, knowing you're prepared for emergencies. For me, it's 3%, but your number might be different, and that's perfectly fine.\n\nThis is my \"sleep well at night\" money. It's cash I can access quickly when I need it. For me, that's 3% of my wealth, but here's the thing—your number might be totally different. That's perfectly okay!\n\nWhat goes here:\n\n- Emergency fund\n- Monthly expenses\n- Short-term savings goals\n- Insurance premiums\n\nThe Middle Layer: Growth Zone (82%)\n\nThis is where most of my money goes—into steady, long-term investments. I call it my \"set and forget\" money. It's not exciting, but it works. Think index funds, reliable dividend stocks, and other investments that don't need daily attention.\n\nWhat goes here:\n\n- Index funds\n- ETFs\n- Blue-chip stocks\n- Retirement accounts\n- Real estate investments\n\nThe Top: Opportunity Zone (15%)\n\nThis is my \"excitement\" money—where I take bigger risks for potentially bigger rewards. But here's the important part: I only put money here that I could lose without ruining my sleep.\n\nWhat goes here:\n\n- High-growth stocks\n- Crypto investments\n- Start-up investments\n- Alternative investments\n\nHow to Find Your Own Numbers\n\nYour perfect split might look completely different from mine, and that's exactly how it should be. Ask yourself:\n\n- How much cash do you need to feel secure?\n- What are your life goals?\n- How much risk can you handle before losing sleep?\n- Do you have kids? A mortgage? Other responsibilities?\n\nThe Sleep-Well Test\n\nI have a simple rule: if your money setup keeps you up at night, it's wrong for you. Period. It doesn't matter what any expert says—your peace of mind comes first.\n\nHere's my personal sleep-well checklist—a set of principles inspired by lessons I've learned and insights from financial legends:\n\nCan I cover 6 months of expenses with my safety money? This is an important safety net. Having this set right will take you through any market down turn. The famous Benjamin Franklin once said: \"I am not concerned with market fluctuations. My peace of mind comes from knowing that my investments are based on sound principles and not borrowed money.\"\n\nAre my growth investments diversified enough? - I once had a client who invested 600.000 EUR into one investment. What accounted for roughly 75% of the entire inherited sum. Not of my taste, to say the least!\n\nIs my opportunity money truly \"optional\"? In light of FOMO people start to tend to underestimate their financial needs for a long time. Can your REALLY spare those $50,000 for 3 years?\n\nMaking It Work for You\n\nRemember, this isn't about copying my numbers. It's about crafting YOUR own perfect balance that matches your unique situation, goals, and temperament. Your financial journey is as personal as your fingerprint.\n\nA friend of mine earned $1,200,000 through exiting his company. His risk tolerance is much higher than mine. He nearly invested 60% into high-risk investments - and it paid out. He is 5x his investment in 4 years. I honestly admire him for his patience and risk tolerance, but I know this wouldn't fit me. Investing isn't about the highest possible profit; it's also about safety. Otherwise you could easily go to the Casino: High returns, high risk. Would you bet 50% of your money on red? Maybe you need 10% in cash to feel secure. Maybe you want 50% in growth investments. That's all good!\n\nYour Next Steps\n\n1.  Calculate your total assets\n2.  Decide on your safety number (months of expenses × monthly costs)\n3.  Choose your growth strategy (index funds, real estate, etc.)\n4.  Set your risk tolerance for opportunities\n5.  Review and adjust quarterly\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe Money Triangle isn't rocket science—and that's exactly the point. It's about organizing your money in a way that makes sense for YOU.\n\nWant to know the best part? You can adjust it anytime. Modern tools make this easier than ever—from budgeting apps like YNAB or Mint to robo-advisors that automate portfolio rebalancing. Flexibility is the cornerstone of financial peace of mind. The good thing is that modern apps, banks, and strategies allow one to adept over time:\n\n- You can start with 70% in moneymarket ETF (like a daily money account)\n- Later, you can go more into risk and invest 80% into an all-world ETF like the Vanguard All-World\n- As your life changes, your triangle can change too\n\nYour Turn\n\nWhat's your ideal money split?

Export your overview as an image.\n3. Use it for future decisions.\n\n> **Looking for a simpler framework?** Check out [the Wealth Triangle](/wealth-triangle) for a straightforward approach to organizing your finances.\n\n## Why You Need a Wealth Canvas\n\nManaging money isn't just about numbers and budgets. It's about understanding how you feel about money, where you are now, and where you want to go. Most financial plans miss this big-picture view, but the Wealth Canvas shows it all.\n\nThink of it like a map for your money, all in one place. It's not just a snapshot—it's a tool that helps you make smart choices.\n\n## How the Wealth Canvas Works: Now vs. Later\n\nThe Wealth Canvas is divided into two main parts:\n\n1. **Your Current Situation**\n2. **Your Future Plans**\n\nBefore you plan for the future, you need to know where you stand today.\n\n### 1. Your Current Situation: Where You Are Now\n\nThis section helps you see your income, expenses, savings, and feelings about money. Knowing these details sets the stage for growing your wealth.\n\n#### A. Monthly Money Streams\n\nTracking your income and spending is key to understanding your cash flow. Are you spending more than you earn? Knowing this can help you make better choices.\n\n**Key Questions to Ask:**\n\n- Where does your money come from? (Examples: paycheck, side jobs, investments)\n- How reliable is each source? A full-time job might be steady, but freelance work can change.\n- What are your regular bills? Examples: rent, electricity, streaming subscriptions.\n- What costs can you cut? Maybe you can switch to a cheaper phone plan or cancel unused services.\n- Do you have expenses you forget? Annual fees like insurance can sneak up on you.\n\n**Break it Down into Three Areas:**\n\n- Income: Money from your job or investments.\n- Regular Costs: Bills and subscriptions.\n- Debts: Loans or credit card balances.\n\n💡 **Tip:** Include yearly costs by dividing them into monthly amounts. This gives you a clearer picture.\n\n#### B. Wealth Position\n\nWealth isn't just about money in the bank. It includes things you own and the people you support. This section helps you see all your assets.\n\n**Important Questions:**\n\n- What valuable things do you own? (Examples: your home, car, stocks)\n- Who depends on you financially? (Examples: kids, parents)\n- Who might need your help later? (Think about future responsibilities.)\n- What other assets do you have? Non-cash resources can be valuable, too.\n\n**Examples of Hidden Assets:**\n\n- Skills or Certifications: These can boost your income.\n- Contacts and Networks: Friends and colleagues who can help you find opportunities.\n- Digital Assets: Domain names or online content.\n- Intellectual Property: Patents or creative works.\n\nWealth is more than numbers—it's your whole financial world.\n\n#### C. Emotional Factors\n\nHow you feel about money affects your choices. Recognizing your money habits can help you avoid mistakes.\n\n**Questions to Reflect On:**\n\n- What's your first memory about money? Early experiences often shape lifelong behaviors.\n- How did your parents handle money? Their habits may influence yours.\n- What money decisions do you regret? Learning from the past helps avoid future errors.\n- What makes you feel confident or nervous about money? Recognizing your feelings helps manage them.\n\n**Common Emotional Patterns:**\n\n- Selling investments too soon when markets drop.\n- Buying things impulsively when stressed.\n- Ignoring important money choices out of fear.\n\nLook for patterns to better understand your financial behavior.\n\n#### D. Investment Personality\n\nYour investment style affects how you balance risks and rewards. Understanding your comfort level can shape your strategy.\n\n**Ask Yourself:**\n\n- How do you feel when your investments lose value? This shows your risk tolerance.\n- How often do you check your portfolio? Frequent checking can signal anxiety.\n- Are you more excited about potential gains or protecting what you have? Your answer shapes your goals.\n\n💡 **Example:** A cautious investor might prefer bonds, while someone willing to take risks might choose stocks or cryptocurrency.\n\nUse this self-awareness to guide your investment choices.\n\n### The Wealth Triangle\n\nThe Wealth Triangle is a framework to organize your finances:\n\n1. **Foundation Zone:** Emergency fund and basic insurance.\n2. **Growth Zone:** Index funds and conservative stocks.\n3. **Opportunity Zone:** Riskier investments like startups or crypto.\n\nFor more, check out my article: The Wealth Triangle: A Simple Way to Build Wealth.\n\n### 2. Your Future Situation: Where You Want to Go\n\nThis section helps you set goals and plan the steps to get there. Thinking about your future keeps you motivated.\n\n#### A. Goals and Vision\n\nClear goals make it easier to stay on track.\n\n**Ask Yourself:**\n\n- What does financial freedom mean to you?

Learn how to make confident purchase decisions and eliminate buyer's remorse for good.","~/assets/images/feature_images/image_9.png","Quick Overview: My Core Principles\n\nSome easy rules for me:\n\n- Under €50: Quick decision okay\n- €50-300: Sleep on it for at least one night\n- Over €300: Several days of consideration\n- Education up to €1,000: Exception rule\n\nThe Battle with Our Monkey Brain\n\nWhat actually happens in our head when we want to buy something? There's this impulsive part of our brain that I like to call \"monkey brain.\" It wants immediate rewards and can't wait. This part of our brain doesn't think about tomorrow - it wants fun RIGHT NOW.\n\nInvestment vs. Feel-Good Purchase: An Important Distinction\n\nFor me, there's a crucial difference between feel-good purchases and investments:\n\nFeel-Good Purchases:\n\n- Pure hedonistic fun\n- Short-term joy\n- Emotional decision\n\nInvestments:\n\n- Long-term thinking\n- Expected returns\n- Rational decision\n\nIt's essential to make that distinction especially when things become more expensive.\n\nThe €4,500 Piano Story\n\nTake my €4,500 digital piano, for example. Sure, it's fun, but it also builds skills. With these mixed categories, I simply look at what predominates. By the way, I didn't make the piano decision spontaneously - I thought about it for three months and wanted to be sure my interest in playing wasn't just a phase.\n\nMy FOMO Resistance\n\nInterestingly, I'm quite resistant to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). I owe that to my father, who was against trends and simply wouldn't buy me things just because they were popular. Today, with clothing, jewelry, or other trendy items, I make decisions completely independent of what others have.\n\nTypical FOMO Traps I Avoid:\n\n- Trending products just because \"everyone has them\"\n- Limited editions\n- Flash sales\n- \"Only available today\" offers\n\nThe Four Basic Rules of My Buying Decisions\n\n1. The Price Level Rule\n\nOver time, I've developed clear rules for different price categories. For amounts under €50, I decide almost immediately. Between €50-100, I pause briefly. For €100-300, I need a conscious decision, and from €300-400 upwards, I sleep on it for at least one night.\n\n2. The Education Exception\n\nEducation is an important exception for me. Anything related to education under €1,000, I buy after a short consideration period of 1-2 days. This attitude comes from my parents, who taught me early on that books and education are always a good investment.\n\nWhat Falls Under the Education Exception:\n\n- Books\n- Online courses\n- Workshops\n- Professional software\n- Educational travel\n\n3. The Fun Account System\n\nTo better manage my feel-good purchases, I've developed a practical system. I maintain a separate WISE account just for these expenses. I transfer between €50-100 there, especially when unexpected money comes in. Recently, I found €50 in my wallet - it went straight to this fun account.\n\n4. The Tech Strategy\n\nFor larger purchases, especially in tech, I also have clear principles. For example, I exclusively buy MacBooks, not because they're trendy, but because they simply work reliably for me.\n\nMy Tech Buying Criteria:\n\n- Real everyday value?\n- Is my old device holding me back?\n- Maintenance costs vs. new purchase\n- Long-term usability\n\nCleverly Managing Special Situations\n\nBlack Friday and Shopping Events\n\nI'm very systematic about Black Friday and other shopping events. I compare prices throughout the year. My experience shows that software is often genuinely cheaper on Black Friday, but for most other things, waiting isn't usually worth it.\n\nThe Subscription Question\n\nI've developed a simple two-question strategy for subscriptions:\n\nBefore Every Subscription, I Ask Myself:\n\n- Do I expect a concrete return?\n- Is it just for fun?\n- How often will I really use it?\n- Are there cheaper alternatives?\n\nWhat I've Learned from All This\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson is that clear rules really help against impulse purchases. A separate fun account makes feel-good purchases much more relaxed, and sometimes consciously going against trends saves real money.\n\nMy Key Insights:\n\n- Clear rules prevent impulse purchases\n- A separate account creates overview\n- Waiting time prevents bad purchases\n- Ignoring trends often saves money\n- Education is the best investment\n\nHow do you handle your feel-good purchases? Do you also have a separate account for them, or how do you approach this topic?

A practical guide to making smart decisions during this emotional time.","I was there with her in her final moments, giving her medicine to help with the pain. It was overwhelming, emotional, and honestly, pretty chaotic. There were so many things left unsaid, both good and bad.\n\nNow I want to help you navigate your first 30 days after inheriting money. This guide will provide actionable steps to help you stay organized, avoid common pitfalls, and make thoughtful decisions during a difficult time.\n\nIt's probably one of the hardest times you'll go through. You're dealing with paperwork, family, grief, and maybe even people who think they deserve a share. Here's what I learned from my experience.\n\n> **Warning:** Before you make any decisions, be sure to read [5 Costly Money Mistakes Heirs Make](/inherit-money-5-costly-mistakes) to avoid common pitfalls that could cost you thousands.\n\nWeek 1: Take a Deep Breath\n\nThe first thing you need to know is that most things can wait. Really. Even though it feels like everything needs immediate attention, that's not true. Here's what you should prioritize:\n\nGather Important Papers\n\nLook for:\n\n- Bank statements\n- Insurance documents\n- House or apartment deeds and mortgage documents\n- Any urgent bills\n- Digital account information (online banking, email, social media)\n- Cryptocurrency or digital investment details\n\nContact List\n\nMake a list of people and organizations to contact:\n\n- Insurance companies\n- Banks and financial institutions\n- The landlord (if there's a rental property)\n- Close family members and the executor of the estate\n- Tax advisor\n- Estate attorney\n- Professional appraiser (for valuable items)\n- Financial planner (especially for larger inheritances)\n\nDocumentation System\n\nSet up an organized system from the start:\n\n- Create digital copies of all important documents\n- Set up separate physical and digital filing systems\n- Start a log of all communications with financial institutions\n- Keep receipts for all estate-related expenses\n- Use a password manager for digital accounts\n\nPlan the Memorial\n\n- Focus on the immediate needs of the memorial service\n- Delegate tasks when possible\n- Keep receipts for all expenses\n\nMost important lesson: Take control of the process. Don't let others rush you into making quick decisions, especially about money. For example, agreeing to sell property without fully understanding its value or signing off on financial accounts too quickly can lead to regrets.\n\nWeeks 2-3: Understanding What You Have\n\nNow, it's time to get a clearer picture of your situation. But remember, you're still grieving, and that's okay. Here's what to do:\n\nCreate an Asset Inventory\n\nDocument everything you've inherited:\n\n- Money (in savings, investments, or other accounts)\n- Property (real estate, vehicles)\n- Valuables (jewelry, collectibles)\n- Digital assets (cryptocurrency, online accounts)\n- Debts (credit cards, mortgages, or loans)\n\nBuild Your Professional Support Team\n\nConsider consulting with:\n\n- Estate attorney for legal guidance\n- Tax advisor for tax implications\n- Financial planner for long-term strategy\n- Grief counselor or therapist\n- Professional appraiser for valuable items\n\nUnderstand Tax Implications\n\n- Consult with a tax professional about:\n  - Inheritance taxes\n  - Estate taxes\n  - Capital gains implications for inherited assets\n  - Required tax filings and deadlines\n  - State-specific tax considerations\n\nWatch for Red Flags\n\nBe alert for common scams targeting inheritors:\n\n- Unsolicited investment opportunities\n- \"Long-lost relatives\" appearing suddenly\n- Fake debt collectors\n- Charity scams\n- Pressure to make quick financial decisions\n\nIdentify Priorities\n\nFocus on what needs immediate attention:\n\n- Utility bills, mortgage or rent, and insurance payments\n- Estate-specific deadlines and requirements\n- Tax filing deadlines\n- Insurance claim windows\n\nKey insight: Trust your instincts. Grieving looks different for everyone. Some may tell you how you should be feeling or acting—ignore them. This journey is uniquely yours.\n\nWeek 4: Starting to Plan\n\nBy now, you should have a better grasp of your inheritance. It's time to think about next steps—but avoid rushing into significant changes.\n\nSelf-Care Priorities\n\n- Set clear boundaries with family members\n- Consider taking time off work\n- Maintain regular routines when possible\n- Join a grief support group\n- Schedule time for rest and reflection\n\nFinancial Planning\n\nStart creating your Wealth Trianlge —but keep it simple for now:\n\n- Savings\n- Investments\n- Spending (daily and discretionary)\n\nSet aside some \"fun money\": Treat yourself to something small—a short trip, a new gadget, or a relaxing day. Allowing a little enjoyment can be a healthy way to ease stress.\n\nMoney Mindset\n\nReflect on your relationship with money. Handling a large sum can be disorienting if you're not used to it. For example, it's easy to feel compelled to pay off all debts immediately or invest in a high-return opportunity without proper research. Moving from managing $10,000 to having $300,000 requires a shift in thinking.\n\nSee also: 10 Signs You are Bad With Money\n\nKey Takeaways\n\n- Don't rush financial decisions. Give yourself permission to take it slow.\n- Allow space for grief. Healing takes time—there's no set timeline.\n- Be mindful of your spending habits. If you inherit a significant amount, remember: your monthly income hasn't automatically changed.\n- Accept that feeling overwhelmed is normal. You're facing a lot at once—be kind to yourself.\n\nSimple 30-Day Checklistw\n\n□ Obtain multiple copies of death certificate\n□ Locate and secure all important documents\n□ Set up document organization system\n□ Contact insurance companies\n□ Notify banks and financial institutions\n□ Begin probate process if necessary\n□ Create inventory of assets and debts\n□ Secure valuable property\n□ Contact tax advisor\n□ Meet with estate attorney\n□ Set up separate account for inherited funds\n□ Review and list all digital assets\n□ Change passwords on important accounts\n□ Start communication log\n□ Join grief support group\n□ Schedule self-care activities\n□ Review insurance policies\n□ Handle immediate bills\n□ Create preliminary budget\n□ Schedule follow-up with financial advisor\n\nI wish someone had shared this advice with me. Remember, you don't have to solve everything right away. Prioritize self-care, and the rest will follow in time.\n\n## Looking Ahead: After the First 30 Days\n\nOnce you've navigated the crucial first month, you'll need to think about the long-term management of your inheritance:\n\n- Consider using [the Wealth Triangle framework](/wealth-triangle) to structure your inheritance for both security and growth\n- If you're ready to invest some of your inheritance, learn [how to start investing](/how-to-start-investing-in-2025) with a beginner-friendly approach\n- Use [the Wealth Canvas](/the-wealth-canvas-a-new-way-to-see-your-money-journey) to visualize how your inheritance fits into your overall financial picture\n\nRemember, there's no rush to make permanent decisions.
