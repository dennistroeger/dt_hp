Quick Overview: My Core Principles

Some easy rules for me:

- Under €50: Quick decision okay
- €50-300: Sleep on it for at least one night
- Over €300: Several days of consideration
- Education up to €1,000: Exception rule

The Battle with Our Monkey Brain

What actually happens in our head when we want to buy something? There's this impulsive part of our brain that I like to call "monkey brain." It wants immediate rewards and can't wait. This part of our brain doesn't think about tomorrow - it wants fun RIGHT NOW.

Investment vs. Feel-Good Purchase: An Important Distinction

For me, there's a crucial difference between feel-good purchases and investments:

Feel-Good Purchases:

- Pure hedonistic fun
- Short-term joy
- Emotional decision

Investments:

- Long-term thinking
- Expected returns
- Rational decision

It's essential to make that distinction especially when things become more expensive.

The €4,500 Piano Story

Take my €4,500 digital piano, for example. Sure, it's fun, but it also builds skills. With these mixed categories, I simply look at what predominates. By the way, I didn't make the piano decision spontaneously - I thought about it for three months and wanted to be sure my interest in playing wasn't just a phase.

My FOMO Resistance

Interestingly, I'm quite resistant to FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). I owe that to my father, who was against trends and simply wouldn't buy me things just because they were popular. Today, with clothing, jewelry, or other trendy items, I make decisions completely independent of what others have.

Typical FOMO Traps I Avoid:

- Trending products just because "everyone has them"
- Limited editions
- Flash sales
- "Only available today" offers

The Four Basic Rules of My Buying Decisions

1. The Price Level Rule

Over time, I've developed clear rules for different price categories. For amounts under €50, I decide almost immediately. Between €50-100, I pause briefly. For €100-300, I need a conscious decision, and from €300-400 upwards, I sleep on it for at least one night.

2. The Education Exception

Education is an important exception for me. Anything related to education under €1,000, I buy after a short consideration period of 1-2 days. This attitude comes from my parents, who taught me early on that books and education are always a good investment.

What Falls Under the Education Exception:

- Books
- Online courses
- Workshops
- Professional software
- Educational travel

3. The Fun Account System

To better manage my feel-good purchases, I've developed a practical system. I maintain a separate WISE account just for these expenses. I transfer between €50-100 there, especially when unexpected money comes in. Recently, I found €50 in my wallet - it went straight to this fun account.

4. The Tech Strategy

For larger purchases, especially in tech, I also have clear principles. For example, I exclusively buy MacBooks, not because they're trendy, but because they simply work reliably for me.

My Tech Buying Criteria:

- Real everyday value?
- Is my old device holding me back?
- Maintenance costs vs. new purchase
- Long-term usability

Cleverly Managing Special Situations

Black Friday and Shopping Events

I'm very systematic about Black Friday and other shopping events. I compare prices throughout the year. My experience shows that software is often genuinely cheaper on Black Friday, but for most other things, waiting isn't usually worth it.

The Subscription Question

I've developed a simple two-question strategy for subscriptions:

Before Every Subscription, I Ask Myself:

- Do I expect a concrete return?
- Is it just for fun?
- How often will I really use it?
- Are there cheaper alternatives?

What I've Learned from All This

Perhaps the most important lesson is that clear rules really help against impulse purchases. A separate fun account makes feel-good purchases much more relaxed, and sometimes consciously going against trends saves real money.

My Key Insights:

- Clear rules prevent impulse purchases
- A separate account creates overview
- Waiting time prevents bad purchases
- Ignoring trends often saves money
- Education is the best investment

How do you handle your feel-good purchases? Do you also have a separate account for them, or how do you approach this topic? Let me know in the comments - I'm super curious about your experiences!
