## Know Yourself First: The Questions That Really Matter

Before you even look at your first ETF, ask yourself these crucial questions about your investment journey.

> **New to money management?** Start with [mastering financial literacy](/financial-literacy) before diving into investing.

### What's Your Investment Timeline?

Your investment horizon changes everything. Are you:

- Saving for retirement in 30 years?
- Planning to buy a house in 5 years?
- Building wealth for your children?
- Creating an additional income stream?

### Life Stage Planning

Your age and life stage matter more than most people think:

- **In your 20s?** You might be able to take more risks and recover from mistakes
- **In your 40s with kids?** You might need more stability
- **Approaching retirement?** You'll want to focus more on wealth preservation

### Future Life Changes

Think about potential future events:

- Marriage or children?
- Career changes?
- Moving to a different country?
- Starting a business?
- Inheriting money?

Each of these events might require different investment approaches.

### Your Real Risk Tolerance

Be honest with yourself:

- Can you sleep when markets drop 20%?
- Do you need regular access to your money?
- How would a 30% loss affect your life?
- What's your actual financial buffer?

## Building Your Investment Strategy

Once you understand your personal investment profile, it's time to build a strategy that works for you.

### The Foundation: Have Savings First

Before you start investing, make sure you have adequate savings. [Learn how to save money effectively](/how-to-save-money) if you haven't built this foundation yet. As a general rule, aim to have 3-6 months of expenses saved before investing significant amounts.

### Choosing the Right Investment Vehicles

For most beginners, ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) offer an excellent starting point. They provide diversification, low fees, and simplicity. Not sure which one to pick? Check out my guide on [how to choose the right ETF in 2025](/how-to-choose-the-right-etf-in-2025-a-simple-guide-for-anxious-and-curious-investors).

### Structuring Your Investments

Consider using frameworks like [the Wealth Triangle](/wealth-triangle) to structure your investments according to your risk tolerance and goals. This approach helps you balance security, growth, and opportunity in your portfolio.

## The Simple Approach to ETF Investing

Let me be straight with you: Most people overcomplicate ETF investing. I know because I've been there. After years of experience and some expensive lessons, I've learned that simpler is usually better. Here's my no-nonsense guide to ETF investing.

### The One-ETF Approach: Why I Keep It Simple

I use one ETF: Vanguard All-World. That's it. No fancy combinations, no sector bets, no emerging market splits. Just one broad market ETF that covers the world's largest companies.

"But what about diversification?" you might ask. Here's the thing: A world ETF already gives you:

- Multiple countries
- Various industries
- Different company sizes
- Natural risk spreading

### Learning From My Mistakes (So You Don't Have To)

When I started, I thought I could outsmart the market. Spoiler alert: I couldn't. I tried picking sector ETFs, thinking I knew which industries would outperform. This cost me returns and peace of mind.

**Common Mistake Alert:** Many investors think they can have both high returns AND complete safety. Here's the truth: You can't. You either get:

- Higher probability of steady returns (lower risk)
- Higher potential returns (higher risk)

But you can't have both. Anyone who tells you different is selling something.

### How Many ETFs Do You Really Need?

My answer? One to five, maximum. Here's why:

- One ETF can give you global coverage
- More ETFs mean more complexity
- More complexity means more decisions
- More decisions mean more chances to make mistakes

## Making Smart Investment Choices

### Choosing Your ETF: What Really Matters

Focus on these key factors:

1. **Total Expense Ratio (TER)**
   - Lower is better
2. **Fund size**
   - Bigger is generally safer
3. **Provider reputation**
   - I prefer Vanguard, but iShares and Fidelity are solid too

  content="Even a small difference in expense ratio can significantly impact your returns over time. A 0.1% vs 0.3% difference might not seem like much, but on a 30-year investment, it could cost you thousands."
/>

### The US Dominance "Problem"

People often worry about US stocks dominating world ETFs. My take? I'm actually fine with it. Here's why:

- Most major global companies are US-based
- These companies operate worldwide anyway
- US markets are highly regulated and transparent

## Handling Market Volatility

### Dealing with Market Downturns

Here's the hardest truth: You will see your investment drop. Maybe 20%, maybe more. My advice:

1. **Start Small**

   - Don't dump your entire inheritance into ETFs at once
   - Start with smaller amounts to get used to market movements
   - Remember: A 2% drop on €1,000 feels very different from a 2% drop on €100,000

2. **Set and (Try to) Forget**
   - I'll be honest - I'm terrible at this myself
   - I check my portfolio too often
   - Don't be like me
   - Set up automatic investments and check less frequently

<InfoBox
  type="warning"
  title="Psychology Matters"
  content="The biggest obstacle to investment success isn't market performance—it's investor behavior. Checking your portfolio too frequently leads to emotional decisions and poor returns."
/>

### My Future Strategy

I'm young now, so I'm 100% in stocks through my world ETF. But here's my plan:

- Continue with this strategy for the next 10-12 years
- Start adding bonds as I approach 45
- Gradually increase bond allocation for more stability

## Your Action Plan

1. Choose one broad market ETF (like Vanguard All-World)
2. Set up a monthly investment plan
3. Start small and increase gradually
4. Resist the urge to check daily
5. Ignore market "experts" predicting crashes

## The Bottom Line

ETF investing doesn't need to be complicated. First, understand your personal situation and goals. Then, choose one solid world ETF, make regular investments, and have patience - that's really all you need. Everything else is just noise.
