# The Ice Cream That Changed Everything

Ever had that moment when you really, really wanted something, but your parents said "no"? Let me take you back to a summer evening that changed how I think about money forever.

Picture this: I'm six years old, sitting in a busy restaurant, my mouth watering at the thought of ice cream. The sweet, cold dessert that every kid dreams about on a hot summer day. When I asked my dad for some money to buy it, he didn't just say no - he gave me a challenge that would shape my entire future.

/>

Most kids might have given up right there. But something clicked in my brain. I looked around the restaurant, grabbed some paper from my mom's purse, and started drawing. Not masterpieces - just simple, kid-style doodles. Then, with my heart pounding but determined to get that ice cream, I did something that probably makes most people cringe: I went from table to table, selling my drawings for 50 cents each.

Guess what? It worked. I got my ice cream that day, but I got something way more valuable too: my first lesson about the connection between money and emotions.

Fast forward to today - I'm managing my own money (that's a lot more ice cream than I could ever eat!). But here's the crazy part: that little kid selling drawings in a restaurant had no idea that twenty-some years later, he'd lose €40,000 in a single investment and be totally okay with it. How is that possible?

## How I Learned About Money and Feelings

Growing up in a middle-class family, we weren't rich, but we weren't poor either. My dad taught me a lot about money - like always saving at least 10% of what I earn (I actually try to save way more now!). He was kind of like my money coach, teaching me to think carefully before buying stuff.

## The Big Discovery: Money and Feelings Are Best Friends

Here's something crazy I discovered in 2021 when I was going to therapy: I noticed that when I was feeling stressed during therapy sessions, I would start trading stocks like crazy! It's like when some people eat lots of ice cream when they're sad - except I was buying and selling stocks.

<InfoBox

  content="In 2021, I spent 20,000 EUR on trading commissions. Luckily, I still managed to get out of 2021 with 8,000 EUR in profit. If I had changed nothing and kept my first trade in 2021, I would have closed the year with roughly 100,000 EUR."
/>

This made me realize something super important: our feelings about money come from way back in our childhood. Just like my ice cream story shaped how I think about earning money, your experiences with money are shaping how you think about it too!

## The Three-Way Check: Your Inner Financial Advisors

When I'm thinking about buying something, I use what I call my "three-way check." I learned this from a smart guy named Tim Ferriss. It's like having three different advisors in your head:

### 1. Your Brain (The Thinking Part)

- Asks: "Does this make sense?"
- Example: When I bought my new MacBook Air, my brain said, "This will help me work faster!"

### 2. Your Heart (The Feeling Part)

- Asks: "How do I feel about this?"
- Example: My heart said, "This feels like a good investment in my work."

### 3. Your Gut (The Instinct Part)

- Asks: "What's my gut telling me?"
- Example: My gut said, "This is the right time to buy it."

## How This Connects to My Wealth Triangle

You might have read about my Wealth Triangle (if you haven't, [check it out here](/wealth-triangle)). It's like a pyramid with three parts:

- The Foundation (safety money)
- The Growth Zone (steady investment money)
- The Opportunity Zone (exciting but risky money)

But here's the cool thing - your feelings affect how you use each part of the triangle! For example, when I was stressed, I wanted to put more money in the Opportunity Zone, which isn't always smart.

## Real Life Example: Learning the Hard Way

Want to hear something that taught me a big lesson? I once invested €40,000 (that's like 40,000 ice creams!) in a friend's company. The company went bankrupt, and I lost all that money. Losing that much money isn't fun and even made me doubt myself sometimes.

<InfoBox
  type="info"
  content="And I think that's completely fine. Taking risks can lead to losses, and losing is no fun. At the same time, it shouldn't keep you from playing."
/>

I didn't feel terrible about it because it was part of my Opportunity Zone money - money I knew I could lose without ruining my life. This is why the Wealth Triangle is so important.

## Smart Money Moves I Make Now

### 1. Books Are Always Worth It

- I buy books whenever I find ones I like
- This comes from my parents always buying me books as a kid
- It's like investing in my brain!

### 2. Quality Food Matters

- I don't eat at fancy restaurants all the time
- But I buy good quality food for cooking
- Think of it like putting good fuel in a car

### 3. Tools That Help Me Work

- Like my MacBook Air story
- Sometimes spending more now saves money later

## Warning Signs to Watch For

When you're making decisions about money, watch out for these feelings:

<InfoBox
  type="warning"
  content="- Feeling rushed ('Buy it now or you'll miss out!')<br/>
- Feeling pressured ('Everyone else is doing it!')<br/>
- Feeling scared of missing out (FOMO)"
/>

If you feel any of these, stop and take a deep breath. Remember: there will always be more chances to make money or buy things you want.

## What I Want You to Remember

The way you think about money is super important. It's not just about having a piggy bank or a savings account - it's about understanding why you make the choices you do with money.

Remember my ice cream story? That little kid learning to earn money for ice cream grew up to manage his own wealth. But the most important thing I learned wasn't about making money - it was about understanding my feelings about money.

### Want to start thinking better about money? Try this:

1. Notice how you feel when you want to buy something
2. Use the three-way check (brain, heart, gut)
3. Remember that there's usually no rush
4. Think about which part of the Wealth Triangle your decision fits into
