# The 20-Year Search for My North Star

Do you feel lost, not knowing what the next step in your life should be? For 20 years, I've been bouncing between molecular biology, SaaS founding, digital marketing, and AI. And through all of it, I never felt like I was coming home. I always felt scattered, sad, and uncertain about the overarching theme of my life.

## Why Finding Your Purpose Matters

You might think "purpose" is just another buzzword. Find your purpose and suddenly everything becomes easier, right? In some sense, that's true. But purpose alone doesn't change anything—you have to live it.

The most important thing about finding your purpose is that it gives you a North Star, an inner compass to help you make decisions:

- Should you work abroad?
- Should you marry that person?
- Should you have children?
- Which job should you take?

All these questions become easier to answer when you have an inner compass guiding you toward what's right for you.

## My Disconnected Journey

All the things I did in my career felt awkwardly disconnected from each other:

- Molecular biology
- Software as a service founder
- Digital marketing
- AI

How did these fit together? I had seriously no clue.

## The AI Breakthrough Moment

Luckily, I started using AI as an interactive journaling tool where I could input my thoughts and receive crystal clear feedback on things I had never considered before.

After entering my data, I got a perspective on my life I'd never had before: **I'm someone who decodes systems**.

The second I read this from the AI, it felt natural. I suddenly realized that this was my overarching theme all along. Whether I was studying molecular biology or building software, I was always decoding systems.

## Niching Up, Not Down

What also helped me—and might help you—is realizing that I don't fit into one box. For me, trying to niche down and put myself in smaller boxes was exactly the wrong approach.

It made me unhappy to think I had to do the same thing for the next 5-10 years. Instead of niching down, I niched up. This is what ChatGPT and other AI tools can do for us—help us see new perspectives and discover what's really important on a level that wasn't visible before.

Now my purpose—"I decode systems"—isn't just a nice idea. It's something I can use to make my business even better.

## The 20-Minute AI Purpose-Finding Process

I'm going to share my simple process that you can do with any large language model like ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok. Here's how it works:

### Step 1: State Your Problem

Open your AI tool of choice and start by clearly stating your problem. Explain who you are, where you are in life, and what's troubling you.

For example, I mentioned that one of my problems was not being able to stick with anything for more than 3-6 months.

### Step 2: Ask for Expert Guidance

Ask the AI what type of professionals could help you solve your problem:

- "Which professional consultant could help me?"
- "What type of coach do you think could solve this riddle?"

/>

### Step 3: Reframe Your Question

Ask the AI to rewrite your prompt from the perspective of the experts that resonated with you. In my case, I asked it to include the existential coach and systems consultant perspectives.

### Step 4: Share Your Backstory

Give the AI your complete background—all the things you've done in your life that seem disconnected. The more details you provide, the better the AI can identify patterns.

### Step 5: Ask for Patterns

Ask directly: "What patterns can you see that I've overlooked? What's the overarching theme in my life?"

For me, the AI described me as a polymath who thrives at intersections. This resonated deeply.

### Step 6: Request Different Perspectives

Ask the AI to describe your purpose from different perspectives. I asked it to describe my purpose as a CEO might, and that's when it came up with "systems decoder"—which instantly clicked.

## Your Purpose as a North Star

Your purpose serves as your North Star, helping you make better decisions. Not knowing what you want can actually be a superpower because you're aware of it and free to explore what should come next.

Remember that feeling lost is often just your subconscious mind telling you that you aren't where you belong. That awareness is the first step toward finding your true path.

## The Power of AI for Self-Discovery

I use ChatGPT and similar tools every day for self-reflection and exploration. They provide an external perspective that can reveal patterns we're too close to see ourselves.

## Your Turn to Find Your Purpose

Now it's up to you. Take 20 minutes to try this process:

1. State your problem clearly
2. Ask which experts could help you
3. Reframe your question from their perspective
4. Share your complete backstory
5. Ask for patterns you've missed
6. Request different perspectives on your purpose

I've created a framework document with prompts you can use (check the description below the video).

## What's Next After Finding Your Purpose?

Finding your purpose is just the beginning. Once you have your North Star, you can:

1. Evaluate current projects against your purpose
2. Make decisions with greater confidence
3. Find connections between seemingly unrelated interests
4. Explain your unique value to others more clearly

## Final Thoughts

Your purpose isn't set in stone. It may evolve as you grow and gain new experiences. The important thing is having that North Star to guide your decisions today.

Take the time to discover yours. Watch this video again if needed, use my prompts, and see what insights emerge. Your future self will thank you for the clarity this process brings.
