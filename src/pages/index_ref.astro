        <p>
          Feeling scattered, trapped by "one niche," or unfulfilled after years of searching? This tutorial, inspired by
          my 25-year journey of decoding systems, guides you to uncover your purpose using AI and reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an ex-molecular biologist, SaaS founder, and Histack CEO who struggled with imposter syndrome and purpose
          until I embraced my polymath nature and launched "I Decode Systems" on YouTube. By following this process,
          you'll decode the systems ruling your life—mindsets, passions, and goals—to live free and focused, just like I
          did.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">What You'll Need</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Access to an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok)</li>
          <li>1-2 hours of quiet time for reflection</li>
          <li>A journal or digital notes for insights</li>
          <li>An open mind to explore your polymath tendencies or feelings of being lost</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Process Steps</h2>

        <div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 1: Identify Your Pain Points and Passions (15-20 Minutes)</h3>
          <p class="font-semibold">Goal:</p>
          <p>
            Pinpoint what's making you feel lost or unfulfilled, and list your passions or pivots, like my journey
            through coding, biology, events, and more.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">Why:</p>
          <p>
            I felt scattered for decades chasing "one niche," but my pain (imposter syndrome, purpose questions) and
            passions (tech, personal growth, philosophy) revealed my purpose as a "system decoder."
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">How:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Write down 3-5 moments where you felt lost, unfulfilled, or like an imposter (e.g., "I pivoted jobs but
              still felt like a fraud," "I love coding but hate fitting one role")
            </li>
            <li>List 3-5 passions or skills you've pursued, even briefly (e.g., music, science, entrepreneurship)</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="mt-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-700 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold">Example (My Reflection):</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Pain Points:</strong> "I felt like a fraud after tanking my SaaS, scaling events to 5,000 but thinking
              it was luck, and delaying YouTube for years."
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Passions:</strong> "Coding since 13, personal development, piano, AI at Histack, exploring philosophy."
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 mb-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 2: Craft an AI Prompt to Explore Your Purpose (10-15 Minutes)</h3>
          <p class="font-semibold">Goal:</p>
          <p>
            Use AI to ask probing questions and reframe your pain and passions into a purpose, like I used ChatGPT to
            overcome imposter syndrome and find my "decode systems" mission.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">Why:</p>
          <p>
            I told ChatGPT, "I want to start a YouTube channel about personal wealth, but I feel like an imposter—help
            me overcome it," unlocking my purpose as a system decoder for polymaths and lost folks.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">How:</p>
          <p>Open your AI tool and input a prompt like:</p>

          <div class="mt-2 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-slate-700 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold">Example Prompt:</p>
            <p>
              "I'm feeling lost and unfulfilled after 25 years of pivoting through [list your roles/passions, e.g.,
              coding, biology, events]. I want to find my purpose—ask me 3-5 questions to uncover it, evaluate my
              answers, and suggest a purpose tying my pain (e.g., imposter syndrome) and passions (e.g., tech, growth)
              together."
            </p>
          </div>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>
              Answer the AI's questions honestly, providing context (e.g., "I feel like a fraud launching a project," "I
              love coding but hate one niche")
            </li>
            <li>Note the AI's evaluation and suggested purpose—look for patterns like my "decoding systems"</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="mt-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-slate-700 p-4 rounded-lg">
            <p class="font-semibold">Example (My Process):</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Prompt:</strong> "I'm feeling lost after 25 years of coding, scaling events, tanking a SaaS, and running
              Histack for AI. I want to find my purpose—ask me 3 questions, evaluate, and suggest a purpose tying my imposter
              syndrome and passions (tech, personal growth, philosophy)."
            </p>
            <p><strong>AI Questions:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>"What's your biggest fear about your work?"</li>
              <li>"What excites you most about your passions?"</li>
              <li>"What impact do you want to have?"</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>My Answers:</strong></p>
            <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>"Fear—I'll be seen as a fake starting YouTube."</li>
              <li>"Excitement—helping polymaths decode chaos like I did."</li>
              <li>"Impact—freeing people from niche traps."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              <strong>AI Evaluation:</strong> "Your purpose could be decoding systems (tech, growth) to help others live
              free as polymaths, overcoming imposter syndrome with your story."

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Step 3: Refine Your Purpose with Reflection (15-20 Minutes)</h3>
          <p class="font-semibold">Goal:</p>
          <p>
            Use your AI insights to craft a personal purpose statement, like my "I decode systems to help polymaths,
            lost souls, and entrepreneurs find clarity and purpose."
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">Why:</p>
          <p>
            I refined my AI insights into launching "I Decode Systems," tying Histack's AI to personal growth
            breakthroughs.
          </p>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">How:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Review your AI responses and journal notes—highlight recurring themes (e.g., "helping others," "breaking

            </li>
            <li>
              Write a purpose statement: "I [verb, e.g., decode, create, guide] [systems or areas, e.g., mindsets, tech]

            </li>
            <li>Test it—does it feel true, like my "I decode systems to help polymaths live free"?</li>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Start a small project tied to your purpose (e.g., a blog, video, or chat with friends)—use AI to guide

            </li>
            <li>
              Share your purpose with 3-5 people—ask, "Does this feel like me?" (Like me testing breakthroughs locally)

            <p>
              <strong>Feedback:</strong> Friends said, "Your system-decoding vibe helps me feel less lost"—validated my purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
